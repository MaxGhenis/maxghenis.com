Prop 68 is a $4 billion general obligation bond for parks, environmental protection, and water infrastructure.

My default vote for ballot measures is "no." I spent several hours researching these, and only feel comfortable making my choices after that investment. Whenever possible, I believe in giving legislators---who have significant investigatory resources---the power to make the best legislation and funding decisions, and similarly giving agencies the power to enact those laws. I voted against Proposition 68 specifically on these grounds.

This bond would tie up the General Fund with unfunded earmarks, limiting the legislature's ability to respond to changing conditions and fund other priorities. State general obligation bonds are repaid from the General Fund without raising any tax revenue, meaning each dollar for debt repayment is a dollar that can't fund other programs.
