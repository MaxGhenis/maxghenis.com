Prop 71 changes when ballot measures take effect, specifying they become law only after the official vote canvas is complete.

This common-sense measure avoids legal issues that could arise if the outcome of a ballot measure changes between election night preliminary results and the final official vote tallies. With the growth of mail-in voting and the time needed to count all ballots, this clarification prevents potential chaos from measures taking effect prematurely.
