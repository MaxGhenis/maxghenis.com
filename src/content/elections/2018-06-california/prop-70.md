Prop 70 would require a one-time two-thirds vote in the legislature to use revenue from the cap-and-trade program.

We should make it easier to budget, not harder. Requiring a supermajority vote for cap-and-trade spending adds unnecessary procedural hurdles that could delay or prevent the use of these funds for environmental and climate programs. California already has too many supermajority requirements that tie the hands of legislators; we shouldn't add another one.
