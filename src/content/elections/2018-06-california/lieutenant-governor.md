Eleni Kounalakis is the only candidate for Lieutenant Governor pledging to address California's most pressing issue: housing. In a state with a 3.6 million home shortage driving up rents and creating the worst poverty rate in the nation, having candidates at all levels of government committed to solving the housing crisis is essential.
