Marshall Tuck understands the importance of teacher reforms for improving education. His support for measures such as extending the pre-tenure probationary period from two to three years represents common-sense reforms that research suggests would improve student outcomes. While these mild reform positions have cost him endorsements from teachers unions, they reflect an evidence-based approach to improving California's schools.
