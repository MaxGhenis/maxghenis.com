Prop 69 requires that revenue from the gas tax be directed to transportation projects as promised.

We should keep our promise about directing gas tax revenue to transportation projects. When voters and legislators approved the gas tax increase, it was with the understanding that the funds would improve California's roads and transit systems. Prop 69 ensures that commitment is honored.
