Proposition 4 issues $1.5 billion in general obligation bonds for children's hospitals, including private hospitals.

### General obligation bonds reduce budget flexibility

This bond would be repaid from the General Fund over many years, reducing the Legislature's ability to respond to changing needs. The $1.5 billion plus interest payments come at the expense of other priorities like K-12 education and safety net programs.

### Private hospitals shouldn't receive public bond funding

While children's hospitals serve an important function, directing public general obligation bond funds to private hospitals is questionable. Private hospitals can access capital markets directly, and their inclusion raises questions about whether this is an appropriate use of state bonding authority.

### Better alternatives exist

If additional funding for children's hospitals is warranted, it could be appropriated through the annual budget process where it can be evaluated alongside other health priorities. This would allow legislators to adjust funding based on actual needs rather than locking in spending for decades.

Vote **no on Prop 4** to maintain budget flexibility and ensure public funds are used appropriately.
