Between October 9 and November 6, 2018, Californians had the opportunity to vote on 16 statewide ballot measures. These measures affected taxes, infrastructure, housing, healthcare, and governance.

## Guiding principles

- **Vote "no" if the legislature can do it.** Ballot measures make government inflexible by requiring more ballot measures to modify them. New taxes and amendments to previous ballot measures must go to the ballot, but when a law can be enacted at the legislature rather than the ballot, it can also be studied and reformed as needed.

- **Vote "no" on budget set-asides, including state general obligation bonds.** Budget set-asides reduce legislators' ability to reprioritize based on changing circumstances and newly available data. California general obligation bonds are also a form of set-aside, since they must be repaid from the General Fund.

- **Vote "no" on tax cuts and "yes" on taxes.** California has pressing challenges that can often be addressed with additional tax revenue.

- **Maximize well-being.** Whether mitigating the impacts of climate change, creating opportunity for newcomers, or improving medical care, I support public policy that helps as many people as possible.
