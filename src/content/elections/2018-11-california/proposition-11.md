Proposition 11 would allow ambulance companies to require EMTs and paramedics to remain on-call during paid breaks, responding to emergencies if needed.

### The legislature should have resolved this

A 2016 court ruling created uncertainty about whether EMTs must be completely relieved of duty during breaks. This is exactly the type of labor dispute that should be resolved through legislation or negotiation rather than a ballot measure.

However, given the life-or-death stakes involved, voters should step in to provide clarity.

### Ambulance response times matter

When someone has a heart attack or severe injury, minutes can mean the difference between life and death. Requiring ambulances to go out of service during EMT breaks would either extend response times or require significant additional ambulances and staff to maintain coverage.

### Costs would be substantial

The Legislative Analyst estimates that without this measure, ambulance costs could increase significantly, potentially affecting healthcare costs and response times. While workers deserve breaks, the on-call nature of emergency services requires flexibility.

### EMTs would still get paid breaks

Prop 11 doesn't eliminate breaks — it allows EMTs to be interrupted if an emergency arises. The proposition requires employers to provide certain benefits if breaks are interrupted.

Vote **yes on Prop 11** to ensure ambulance availability for emergencies.
