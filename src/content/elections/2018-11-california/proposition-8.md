Proposition 8 would cap dialysis clinic revenues at 115 percent of direct patient care costs plus certain other expenses.

### This is a labor dispute, not a healthcare policy

Prop 8 emerged from a dispute between dialysis companies and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU-UHW) over unionization. Using the ballot initiative process to gain leverage in labor negotiations is an abuse of direct democracy.

### Complex healthcare regulations don't belong on the ballot

Healthcare pricing and regulation involves complex tradeoffs that are better handled by legislators and regulators who can study the issues, consult experts, and make adjustments as needed. Ballot measures are inflexible — once passed, they're difficult to modify even if they have unintended consequences.

### Could put dialysis patients at risk

Dialysis patients depend on regular treatment to stay alive. The Legislative Analyst warns that some clinics could close or reduce services under these restrictions, potentially forcing vulnerable patients to travel further or wait longer for treatment.

### Profit caps are a blunt instrument

If dialysis companies are earning excessive profits, there are better regulatory approaches than a ballot measure with an arbitrary 115 percent cap. The legislature could investigate pricing, increase competition, or implement more targeted regulations.

Vote **no on Prop 8** to keep labor disputes out of healthcare policy.
