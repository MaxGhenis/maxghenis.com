Proposition 7 would give the California Legislature the power to change the state's daylight saving time period, including potentially making daylight saving time year-round (with federal approval).

### Gives the legislature appropriate flexibility

Currently, California's daylight saving time is set by a 1949 ballot measure. Modifying it requires another ballot measure. This is unnecessarily rigid — the legislature should be able to make decisions about time changes without going to voters for every adjustment.

Prop 7 doesn't automatically change anything; it simply gives elected legislators the authority to act if they determine it's in the state's interest. This is how most policy decisions should work.

### Biannual time changes have costs

Research suggests the biannual "spring forward" and "fall back" disruptions have health and productivity costs, including increased heart attacks and car accidents in the days following time changes. While the evidence is mixed, giving the legislature power to address this makes sense.

### Federal coordination required

Even if Prop 7 passes and the legislature acts, year-round daylight saving would require federal approval under the Uniform Time Act. This ensures California wouldn't be completely out of sync with other states — the legislature would only be able to make changes the federal government permits.

Vote **yes on Prop 7** to give legislators appropriate authority over time policy.
