measureId: 'Proposition 12'
position: 'yes'
summary: 'Mandate space requirements for farm animals. Humane and pro-environment despite preference for legislative approach.'

Proposition 12 would establish minimum space requirements for egg-laying hens, breeding pigs, and calves raised for veal, applying to both California farms and products sold in California.

### Humane treatment of animals is a valid policy goal

Factory farming often confines animals in spaces so small they cannot turn around or extend their limbs. This causes suffering that society has an interest in preventing. Setting minimum space standards is a reasonable approach to balancing agricultural efficiency with animal welfare.

### Environmental benefits

Industrial animal agriculture is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. While Prop 12 doesn't eliminate factory farming, improved conditions can reduce some environmental impacts, and higher costs may modestly reduce consumption of animal products.

### Would ideally be legislated

Complex regulatory standards like specific square footage requirements are typically better set through the legislative and regulatory process, where experts can study the issues and standards can be adjusted based on new information.

However, the legislature has not acted, and animal welfare organizations and advocates believe the ballot initiative is necessary to achieve meaningful reform.

### Builds on previous voter-approved standards

California voters approved Proposition 2 in 2008, which required more space for egg-laying hens but lacked specific measurements. Prop 12 clarifies and strengthens those standards while extending protections to pigs and calves.

Vote **yes on Prop 12** for more humane treatment of farm animals.
