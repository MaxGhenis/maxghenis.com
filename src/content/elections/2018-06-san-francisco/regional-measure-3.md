Improving transit with a bridge toll increase will be progressive, safe, and green. I live near the Bay Bridge, and both see and breathe its extreme congestion each time I leave my apartment (my neighborhood has some of the worst air quality in the city). Drivers are richer than non-drivers, making bridge tolls progressive. With better transit and less bridge driving, our air quality will improve; the region will reduce its reliance on cars and their associated traffic incidents; and we will have greater incentive to build housing near jobs as workers seek to avoid the higher tolls. RM3 is a strong step toward more sustainable transportation.
