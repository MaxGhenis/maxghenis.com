position: 'no'
summary: 'Taser policy should be set by career experts like the Police Commission who can adapt based on new research, not locked in by ballot measure.'

Prop H would adopt the San Francisco Police Officers Association's taser use policy rather than that approved by the Police Commission. The research on tasers is unclear: a recent study found that tasers reduced injuries for police but not civilians, and did not reduce firearm use. Another 2009 study funded by the Department of Justice found that under 1 percent of taser uses resulted in significant injuries. Taser policy should therefore be guided by career experts like the Police Commission, who can adapt the policy based on San Francisco's experience and new research. Should any adjustments be needed, passing this ballot measure would set the policy in stone until another ballot measure can amend it. This is a matter best left to government officials.
