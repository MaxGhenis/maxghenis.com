Prop A enables the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission to fund clean power projects in the same way they currently fund water and sewer projects: bonds approved by the Mayor and two thirds of the Board of Supervisors. This is not an unfunded liability (like California Prop 68), as these projects recoup their investment with utility fees. I would have preferred nuclear energy not be excluded, but San Francisco isn't about to build a nuclear power plant anyway, so this clause just preempts attacks.
