San Francisco's 2018 primary election is on Tuesday, June 5.

After two years in San Francisco, I've seen more of the importance of each elected office and measure, including among Democrats. Despite 81% of San Franciscans registering as Democrats (of registered voters with a party preference), there are serious divides on fundamental issues such as housing.

My default vote for ballot measures is "no." I spent several hours researching these, and only feel comfortable making my choices after that investment. Whenever possible, I believe in giving legislators---who have significant investigatory resources---the power to make the best legislation, and similarly giving agencies the power to enact those laws.

For a nonpartisan overview, I recommend [bythebay.cool](https://bythebay.cool/election/props/), from the same creators as ballot.fyi on the 2016 California propositions. While I don't fully agree with their summaries, the site provides a thorough and engaging overview of these complicated bills.
