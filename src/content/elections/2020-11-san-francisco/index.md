I lived in San Francisco from 2016 to 2019, and still follow its politics.
See also these voter guides (I don't fully agree with them, but they are well-researched):
* [SF YIMBY](https://www.sfyimby.org/endorsements)
* [SPUR](http://spur.org/voter-guide/san-francisco-2020-11)
* [Tech Worker Voter Guide](https://techworkers.vote/) (which also describes why each measure is on the ballot)
