Olivieri and Quick are among the candidates running against incumbents Tom Temprano and Shanell Williams.
They support housing on land controlled by the board, with Olivieri having been [previously endorsed](https://yimbyaction.org/yimby-urbanist-voter-guide-2018/
) by YIMBY (they didn't endorse for school or college board this cycle).
I voted for Olivieri when he ran in 2018---[here's why](https://maxghenis.medium.com/victor-olivieri-and-thea-selby-for-san-francisco-city-college-board-91523b467c43).

Williams [sought to delay](https://www.inglesidelight.com/1100-unit-balboa-reservoir-development-project-clears-two-supervisor-committees/) approval of a housing development at Balboa Reservoir, of which the board has control.
Temprano has been [more supportive](https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/ccsf-board-disagrees-over-future-of-balboa-reservoir-development/) of the project, but has not committed to maximizing total housing units at the site.
