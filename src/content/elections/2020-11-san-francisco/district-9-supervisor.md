Incumbent Hillary Ronen is running unopposed.
She has consistently opposed housing, [in her](https://missionlocal.org/2019/02/how-to-not-build-in-san-francisco-maximus-and-the-so-called-monster-in-the-mission/?unapproved=664873&moderation-hash=3e884ef764ee4a50f17b6fe35c97ff23#comment-664873) [district](https://missionlocal.org/2019/02/how-the-developer-of-sfs-historic-laundromat-quietly-won/) and [across California](https://sf.curbed.com/2019/3/26/18281546/sf-mar-wiener-sb-50-resolution-letter-transit-housing-density).
