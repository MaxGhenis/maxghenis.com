Prop B aims to address [corruption in the Department of Public Works](https://www.kqed.org/news/11821145/months-after-sf-public-works-boss-nurus-arrest-staff-push-for-corruption-cleanup) by creating a new Department of Sanitation and Streets, moves DPW oversight from the City Administrator to a new Public Works Commission, and requires new annual audits and analysis.

As [techworkers.vote said](https://www.techworkers.vote/elections/2020-november/san-francisco/propositions/#prop-a), "this is performative accountability."
Commissions don't have actual power, and moving people to a new department---to the tune of at least $2.5 million annually---doesn't change any incentives.
