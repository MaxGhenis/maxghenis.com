[Philhour's](https://www.votemarjan.com/) website's housing section is unambiguous:
>Marjan supports building housing of all types, including 100% affordable, in-law units, and new apartment buildings.

She also supports transit and safe infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists, for public safety, economic inclusivity, and the environment.
As a small business owner and organizer of other small business owners, she supports simplified permitting to stop giving NIMBY neighbors ([including competitors](https://medium.com/yimbyneoliberal/the-great-falafel-debacle-27231edce59e)) unlimited authority to keep new businesses from opening.

[Shinzato](https://veronicashinzato.com) also supports re-evaluating requirements that prevent or slow down the production of new housing, such as parking requirements and discretionary permitting.
She also supports creating new bike lanes and supporting people experiencing homelessness and people with mental health needs.

The competition wants to preserve District 1's exclusionary low density.
Tropes like [Connie Chan's "100 percent affordable housing"](https://www.conniechansf.com/post/affordable-and-vibrant-neighborhoods) are proven recipes to build nothing:
if apartments are illegal, even public monies can't produce below-market-rate housing, and developers by definition can't build entirely below-market-rate housing without subsidy.
[David Lee's call](https://www.votedavidlee2020.com/priorities) to "stand up to real estate interests" really means "stand up to newcomers seeking to live in District 1."
His Trumpian "Richmond First" slogan really means, "only people who currently live in the Richmond matter."

Philhour and Shinzato are the pro-housing, pro-inclusivity candidates in the race.
