[Sauter](https://www.dannyd3.com/) seeks to provide District 3 with new leadership.
It is desperately needed.

Incumbent Aaron Peskin has, since being first elected in 2000, authored and supported [legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Peskin#Housing_and_development) that has plunged San Francisco into its housing crisis.
He's tried to block allowing housing at a hotel site and on Treasure Island.
When not outright opposing housing projects, he has promoted tools like CEQA and historic preservation to de facto reduce the number of homes.
He introduced [legislation](https://www.aaronpeskin2020.com/biography) that raises the share of housing units developers must reserve for low- and middle-income tenants to 32 percent; similar legislation [cratered development](https://medium.com/yimby/the-25-inclusionary-rate-is-killing-affordable-housing-db143c4abd31).
And he's led [city resolutions](https://www.sfweekly.com/news/s-f-supervisors-call-for-amendments-to-sb-827/) to formally oppose state laws like SB 827 to legalize apartments.

Peskin's bad policy extends beyond housing.
He's proposed [banning employee cafeterias](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-s-proposed-employee-cafeteria-ban-not-to-13121402.php) that create jobs for food workers, and wants to [tax vacant storefronts](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2020/02/20/two-takes-on-the-vacancy-tax-ballot-measure.html), even if they're waiting on permits.
He [capped permits](https://icosahedron-megalodon-8y6y.squarespace.com/results-page/#environmental) for alternative mobility options like bikeshare and scooters that reduce vehicle reliance.
During the pandemic, he's enacted price controls on delivery companies and opposed the initial version of Measure RR to fund Caltrain with a sales tax.

Finally, Peskin is personally unfit to serve the people of San Francisco.
He has performed his duties while [intoxicated](https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/SF-firefighters-say-Supervisor-Peskin-12803523.php), and is known for harassment.
He [illegally converted](https://medium.com/@vwoo/the-hypocrisy-of-aaron-peskin-177a8a739423) a rent-controlled duplex into a single home, abusing his power, and then proposed legislation to slow even minor modifications to similar projects.

Sauter could not be more different.
On [housing](https://www.dannyd3.com/housing), he wants to "legalize apartment buildings," "reform discretionary review,"
"prioritize transit-oriented development," and, for the first time in almost two decades, "set a goal and strategy for District 3 housing."
On [transportation](https://www.dannyd3.com/transit), he wants to make it safer for pedestrians and bicyclists to get around, and improve transit.
He's the respectful, thoughtful, policy-oriented leader District 3 deserves.
