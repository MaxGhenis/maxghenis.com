Melgar, a current planning commissioner, [wants to](https://www.myrnamelgar.com/housing) "build more housing at every income level" and "encourage accessory dwelling units."
She is alone in the field in this view.

Opponent [Joel Engardio](https://www.engardio.com/housing), for example, "opposes attempts to eliminate or rezone single-family neighborhoods."

Stephen Martin-Pinto doesn't mention housing on his [platform](https://www.stephenmartinpinto.com/my-platform), instead calling for counterproductive zero-tolerance homelessness policies.

Ben Matranga also [doesn't mention housing](https://www.benmatranga.com/priorities).

Emily Murase [promises](https://pdfhost.io/v/ReB4ayU8Y_EmilyMurasePositionspdf.pdf) to protect zoning for single family homes, and is "not unequivocally supportive of new housing along transit corridors."

Vilaska Nguyen says, "Our neighborhoods are singular and architecturally unique and need to be preserved for future generations."
(Read: He will continue banning apartments.)

Legalizing apartments---any apartments---in the low-density District 7 should be a low bar in our progressive moment.
Instead, all candidatesare siding with Donald Trump in preserving apartment bans---all candidates except Myrna Melgar.
