Prop H removes a number of unnecessary and counterproductive roadblocks to starting and operating a business.
For example, it streamlines the process for public engagement, which has added months to activities as minor as [opening an ice cream shop](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/heatherknight/article/Bid-to-open-S-F-ice-cream-shop-turns-into-a-15614815.php).
It also legalizes the cafe/workspace model in certain districts, allows restaurant service in parklets (as the city has temporarily allowed for public health reasons), and makes other changes to help businesses commence and modify their activities without permission from City Hall and neighbors.

Ideally, this would be passed as legislation, but the Board of Supervisors has [failed to act](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/S-F-small-businesses-are-struggling-Here-s-15626450.php), so Mayor Breed brought the choice to voters.

As San Francisco recovers from Covid-19's economic collapse, its failed limitations will become a bigger drag than they've already been.
Prop H fixes issues that have long plagued the city, at a time when it especially needs them to be fixed.
