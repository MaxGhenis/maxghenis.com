[Brown](https://www.votevallie.com/) gets it on housing. She [promises to](https://www.votevallie.com/recovery):
>Zone our neighborhoods for affordability with higher levels of density to meet the public demand for more housing and more 100% affordable housing. This must include removing the restrictions that have been designed to keep low-income renters out.

and
>Create new and denser housing on underutilized lots in the district on former commercial land and in our neighborhood corridors.

Brown was one of only two supervisors to [vote against a slanderous resolution](https://www.thebaycitybeacon.com/politics/city-hall-summarized-housing-fails/article_e48523ae-5c77-11e9-b30c-8b16108deea6.html) to oppose SB 50, the state bill that would legalize apartments in transit- and job-rich areas.
Her opponent, current supervisor Dean Preston, [made it clear](https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/wiener-calls-sf-supervisors-vote-against-sb50-a-sad-day/) that he would have voted for the resolution to oppose SB 50.

She's far from just talk, having [approved housing](https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/long-delayed-housing-plan-on-divisadero-street-approved/) in her district as supervisor.
Preston tried to block the project by [raising below-market requirements](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/186-apartments-to-replace-Touchless-car-wash-on-13992038.php).

Preston would prefer a parcel remain empty than for people be able to live in non-100-percent-subsidized apartments there.
Brown recognizes that 100 percent of zero is zero, and that people can only live in homes, not percentages.
