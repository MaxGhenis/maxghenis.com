Parker is one of several candidates running against incumbents Jenny Lam and Mark Sanchez for re-election.
Lam and Sanchez are mismanaging the Covid-19 crisis, dedicating resources to [school renamings](https://abc7news.com/san-francisco-schools-renamed-sfusd-third-sf-renaming-committee-slavery/7085284/) instead of bringing kids back.

In [November 2018](https://maxghenis.medium.com/phil-kim-and-john-trasvi%C3%B1a-for-san-francisco-board-of-education-357b3a628f34), I did not vote for Parker, given her opposition to charter schools and proposal to reserve housing for teachers.
I still oppose those stances, and I couldn't find evidence that she's changed them, but she is a qualified, [pro-tech](https://www.techworkers.vote/elections/2020-november/#michelle-parker), [pro-housing](https://yimbyaction.org/yimby-urbanist-voter-guide-2018/) candidate with a good chance of winning a seat and otherwise good values.

Another candidate I voted against in 2018 is Alida Fisher, who shared her outright nativism in a [2018 questionnaire](https://maxghenis.medium.com/phil-kim-and-john-trasvi%C3%B1a-for-san-francisco-board-of-education-357b3a628f34):
>Lotteries for low and middle income housing, as well as down payment assistance programs, should also provide priority or tie breaker options for young San Franciscans whose families have been in San Francisco for at least a generation.

Parker would be better than the incumbents and the competition.
