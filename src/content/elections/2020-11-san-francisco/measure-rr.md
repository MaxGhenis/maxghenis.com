Measure RR is a sales tax to fund Caltrain.
Without it, Caltrain risks shutdowns.
Rail transit is critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, and provides affordable transportation options for people who don't want to incur the large expenses of vehicle ownership.
Sales taxes avoid distortions of some of the other more convoluted taxes on the San Francisco ballot, and the progressive benefits of public transit far outweights its mild regressivity.
