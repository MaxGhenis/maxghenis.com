[Ting](https://www.philting.com/) focuses less on housing than his peers Chiu and Wiener, but he still votes reliably for pro-housing legislation.
As chair of the Assembly Budget committee, he has notably promoted the [expansion of CalEITC](https://a19.asmdc.org/californias-earned-income-tax-credit), a cash transfer to low-income Californians.
CalEITC [effectively reduces poverty](https://calbudgetcenter.org/resources/expanding-the-caleitc-a-smart-investment-to-broaden-economic-security-in-california/) in California and is a step toward basic income.

His opponent, [John McDonnell](http://johnmcdonnellforassembly.com/), is a Republican who demonizes people experiencing homelessness and the gas tax, and advocates protecting Prop 13's inequitable property tax system.
While I agree with him on some views like equal protection, allowing gig work, and supporting charter schools, a vote for any Republican is, today and for years to come, a vote for Trumpism and the GOP, which have failed our country and our state.
