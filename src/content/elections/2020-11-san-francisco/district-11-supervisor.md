[Safai](https://www.ahshaforsupervisor.com) approved housing in his district and was one of only two supervisors to vote against the anti-SB50 resolution.

His opponent, former supervisor [John Avalos](https://avalos2020.com/issues/housing-affordability-16), is more of the same that has gotten San Francisco into its crisis, saying:
>Top-down policies that push luxury development into our neighborhoods without concern for affordability and community stability will not solve our housing crisis.
