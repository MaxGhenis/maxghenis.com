Bert is the incumbent.
He's not incredibly pro-housing, but he has supported some recent projects and was the only member to vote against the [extreme rent control law](https://maxghenis.medium.com/oxnards-rent-control-proposal-would-do-more-harm-than-good-4810a1a6f45).
His main competition is from NIMBY Douglas Partello.
