Valdez and Thibault Robert are running to replace [Andres Santamaria](https://www.calleguas.com/about-calleguas-municipal-water-district/board-of-directors-details.asp?idBio=4).
I couldn't find any information on either candidate, but I could at least verify with Google that Valdez is a real person.
I found nothing on Robert.
The Greater Oxnard Organization of Democrats also [endorsed Valdez](https://greateroxnarddemocrats.com/voting-guide/), but didn't provide a rationale (for her or any other candidate; also no questionnaire responses).
