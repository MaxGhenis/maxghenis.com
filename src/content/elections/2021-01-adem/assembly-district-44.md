AD44 runs from Thousand Oaks to Oxnard. I live here, I'm running here, and I've done more research on candidates here than any other district.
I've spoken with some other pro-housing candidates such as Josh Donner, David Pollock, and Michaela Perez,
and I generally prefer [their slate](https://linktr.ee/electprogressivelaborad44) to the competing one, which is more DSA-aligned.
However, I'm limiting my votes to candidates who submitted favorable YIMBY or CCL questionnaire responses.
This includes candidates from both slates and independents like myself.

* **Max Ghenis** is me. My website, [maxforadem.com](http://maxforadem.com) has my platform and background.
* **Rebekah Sneha Daniel** strongly supports the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, CCL's federal carbon fee-and-dividend legislation.
* **Martha Martinez-Bravo** strongly supports Citizens' Climate Lobby and is generally supportive of new housing, while also being open about wanting to learn more about the issue.
* **Anthony Mireles** is a union leader who supports housing.
* **Mercy Urrea** is also a union leader who supports housing.
* **Orion Tripodis** strongly supports carbon fee-and-dividend.
* **Alessandro Neri** supports housing development and carbon fee-and-dividend.
* **Henry Montalvo** chairs the Ventura County Democratic Party and generally supports policies that will increase the supply of housing.
* **Danny Chulack** didn't complete either questionnaire, but he completed the YIMBY questionnaire when he ran for Thousand Oaks City Council in November. He earned our endorsement with his strong responses, and I'm confident he'd support housing at the convention and on the Central Committee.
