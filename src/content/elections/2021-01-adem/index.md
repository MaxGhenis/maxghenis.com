The ADEM elects delegates to the California Democratic Party, who control endorsements, platforms, and rules at the annual party convention.
In Ventura County (AD37, AD38, and AD44), ADEM delegates also sit on the Central Committee, which performs the same function at the county level.

Read my [op-ed in the VC Reporter](https://vcreporter.com/2021/01/power-to-speak-the-most-important-election-youve-never-heard-of-is-happening-right-now/) for more info,
as well as rationale for [my own ADEM run](http://maxforadem.com) in AD44.

If you live outside Ventura County, I recommend following endorsements from
[YIMBY Action](https://yimbyaction.org/endorsements/adem) and
[California YIMBY](https://cayimby.org/adems-2021/).
The housing issue divides California Democrats, and YIMBY is on the right side.
