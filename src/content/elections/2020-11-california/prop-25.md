Prop 25 replaces California's cash bail system with a risk assessment system.

Cash bail advantages wealthier people charged with crimes, and [evidence from Orange County](https://escholarship.org/content/qt3qz81051/qt3qz81051.pdf) suggests that "pending bail reform measures in California and elsewhere, which replace cash bail with risk assessment screening and non-monetary supervised release, can be implemented without sacrificing appearances in court." This is a positive step in reducing time spent in jail and building a fairer criminal justice system.
