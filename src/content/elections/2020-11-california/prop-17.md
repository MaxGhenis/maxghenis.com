Prop 17 would allow California residents on state parole, currently about [50,000 people](https://lao.ca.gov/ballot/2020/Prop17-110320.pdf), to vote.

Criminal disenfranchisement has a [racist history](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.115840?casa_token=QKOG0C3CPe0AAAAA%3AONUcwgCcpE8TdxZR9qHmwgGaXYraT2ue-shrcmQG8SC3_I7G0vBR9SkSInwT21fh1g4VBjWEpdXqtA) and is [unsupported by the public](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/68/2/275/1826953?casa_token=h7rFgHByJrYAAAAA:1hEGASOh-4oUnQXpc61X1r4icBwx11Erqtdv0rypqYPRruQJMLqgs5tgU79206g5CbqUIPz5D2RGqA). There is no evidence that it deters crime, and if anything, it may increase it, given the association between voting and [reduced recidivism](http://users.cla.umn.edu/~uggen/Preview.pdf). Given parental turnout [predicts children's turnout](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1065912916640900?casa_token=8DCQChLVQ54AAAAA:E6-81JAZEC0Z_SFS_KCmT7Us73vBr2F8bHug1ephqq0t5AXMKdfMtcmCw0PeK1rPIXDyKJkmXdq-AQ), criminal disenfranchisement may be suppressing political participation across generations.

Granting parolees the franchise can address these ills. It will not the final step in increasing political participation: [informing parolees of their new rights](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/morse/files/iowa.pdf), joining [Vermont and Maine](https://www.spur.org/voter-guide/san-francisco-2020-11/prop-17-voting-rights-people-parole) in allowing prisoners to vote, making it easier for young people to vote, enabling non-citizens to serve on commissions, and many other reforms will help as well. But Prop 17 makes substantial progress toward a more inclusive democracy.
