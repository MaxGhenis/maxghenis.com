position: 'yes'

Prop 18 allows 17-year-olds who will be 18 at the time of the next general election to vote in primaries and special elections.
Expanding the franchise promotes democracy, and by giving 17-year-olds the opportunity to vote in these lower-stakes elections while still at home with higher-voting-propensity parents, this could feed a cycle of improved voter participation long-term, especially among young people.
For a deeper justification of this kind of policy change, based on [this New York Times investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/upshot/youth-voting-2020-election.html) and empirical studies, see my recommendation to vote yes on San Francisco Prop G below.
