Prop 20 increases penalties for theft-related crimes, and makes it harder to get out of prison early. This plainly goes the wrong direction on criminal justice reform, where the [United States leads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate#Main_table) in destroying lives. Vote no.
