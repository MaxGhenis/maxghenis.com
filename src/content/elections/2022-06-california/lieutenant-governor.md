[I voted for now-Lieutenant Governor Kounalakis in the 2018 primary](), while suggesting that California join the seven other states without a Lieutenant Governor office.
Since her election, I haven't really heard anything noteworthy about her (again indicating that we'd be fine without the position), but now that she's running for re-election, she has no serious Democratic opponents.
