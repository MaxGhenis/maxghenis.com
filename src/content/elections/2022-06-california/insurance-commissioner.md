I basically agree with [GrowSF](https://growsf.org/voter-guide#insurance-commissioner) here: incumbent Ricardo Lara isn't great, especially his move to force insurance companies to cover high-risk properties (he also wrote legislation around this in the Assembly before becoming Insurance Commissioner).
In fact, I think I made the wrong call [voting for him over Steve Poizner in 2018](https://maxghenis.medium.com/ricardo-lara-for-insurance-commissioner-8ff0ced82b03).
But nobody else is better this cycle.
