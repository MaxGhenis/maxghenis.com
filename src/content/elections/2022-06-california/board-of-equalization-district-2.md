As I wrote in 2018, [the Board of Equalization ostensibly  doesn't do much](https://maxghenis.medium.com/malia-cohen-for-board-of-equalization-district-2-8ec8a31958ed) and I'd prefer if it were abolished, but the election can be important to the extent that members move on to other political office.
Indeed, the candidate I endorsed then, Malia Cohen, won her seat and is now running for Controller.

The two Democrats running are former San Francisco Supervisor [Michela Alioto-Pier](https://www.michelaaliotopier.com) and former Assemblymember [Sally Lieber](https://www.sallylieber.org/).
While they seem similarly qualified on paper, Lieber doesn't seem to be running a serious campaign; her website doesn't even list her endorsements (given the absence of policy impact the role involves, this is the main signal).
