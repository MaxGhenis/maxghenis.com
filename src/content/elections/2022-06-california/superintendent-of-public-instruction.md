In 2018, [I voted for Marshall Tuck for Superintendent](https://maxghenis.medium.com/marshall-tuck-for-state-superintendent-of-public-instruction-69c5ed3ad607), a reformer who narrowly lost to Tony Thurmond.
Thurmond supports childcare subsidies and teacher housing over charter schools and rewards for high-performing teachers.
Unfortunately, he doesn't have any serious liberal challengers, and so he'd be most qualified for the job.
