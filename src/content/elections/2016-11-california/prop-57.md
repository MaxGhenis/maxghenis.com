While this would ideally go through the legislative process, the scales are tilted so far against nonviolent criminals that making them eligible for parole is a positive. I side with Governor Brown on this. As an aside, see the [official argument](http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/en/propositions/57/arguments-rebuttals.htm) against the proposition for some over-the-top fearmongering.
