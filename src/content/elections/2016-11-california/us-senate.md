Harris and Sanchez have [very similar positions](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-harriz-sanchez-california-senate-questions-20161014-snap-htmlstory.html) across many issues, including, Social Security, clean power, refugees, high-speed rail, criminal justice reform, and the national debt. However, I support Harris for three core reasons:

- Harris has proposed expanding programs like EITC and CTC, important stepping stones to a universal basic income, which I strongly support;
- While both candidates oppose TPP, Harris has had more pro-trade statements when discussing it. Harris's criticisms are more on environmental grounds while Sanchez's are on general trade and manufacturing ground. Economists agree that free trade is a net benefit to the US as well as developing countries, and the reality is that automation has had a far greater impact on manufacturing employment than globalization.
- Sanchez has a moderate voting record for a Democrat, so Harris is more likely to continue California's liberal leadership in the Senate.
