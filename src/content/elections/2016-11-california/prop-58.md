This is a wonky one. To quote the nonpartisan [ballot.fyi](https://ballot.fyi/58/): "It comes down to the pedagogical question, *How should students, who are not fluent in English, best learn English?*" I'm more compelled by this angle than arguments such as favoring bilingual education for English speakers, particularly considering rapid advances in translation technology. Per the research ballot.fyi summarized, bilingual education either performs the same or better than English immersion: although the only randomized controlled trial (the gold standard of social science research) on the topic found no difference, five meta-analyses since 1985 all favored bilingual education. While the public would ideally vote on such a far-reaching matter armed with more conclusive evidence, this swayed me.
