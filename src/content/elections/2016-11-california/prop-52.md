Prop 13 serves as a cautionary tale of the style of permanent changes from propositions embodied in Prop 52. In practice, it is very unlikely to change anything, since the Legislature has every reason to continue approving the hospital fees to get Medicare funds. But should some change occur, it removes their flexibility to adapt, requiring a two-thirds majority or a new proposition (which only get a reasonable response every four years). It's also simply too wonky for a proposition, which should be simple enough for most voters to understand. This is a matter best left to the Legislature.
