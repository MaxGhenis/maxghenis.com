As both 62 and 66 may pass, and the one of the two with more "yes" votes will supersede the other, anyone looking to repeal the death penalty should vote no on 66, virtually regardless of the content. That 66 speeds up the process, thereby increasing the likelihood of the state killing an innocent person, is extra reason to vote no.
