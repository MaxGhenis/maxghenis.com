Lifting marijuana prohibition will raise money for the state and improve safety of weed-smoking. While it won't reduce the prison rolls much due to prior California laws, it sets the stage for more legalization across the country, where the pot-focused drug war wastes billions and destroys low-income communities (especially those of color). I was also worried about special interests like those that pushed Ohio's law, but we seem to be doing this the right way. This is the proposition I'm most excited to vote on.
