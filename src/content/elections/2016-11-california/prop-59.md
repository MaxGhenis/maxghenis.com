A very reluctant yes. Ballots shouldn't be cluttered with measures that have no impact. If the US Congress wants to know what Californians think about *Citizens United*, they can look at the polls. *But*, if I have to give my opinion, I don't want to say I approve of the decision. While my personal thoughts on campaign finance have changed recently due to Trump's rise on the back of "organic" media instead of advertising, I still believe it to be a problem worth addressing.
