Legislative transparency is an area where propositions can help balance voter needs with legislative priorities. Prop 54 requires bills to be posted online for 72 hours and requires recording of legislative proceedings (and allows political ads to use them). Much of the criticism of the bill concerns its financing by Charles Munger, Jr., a Republican who has supported moderate candidates. I'm typically skeptical of such lines of attack; ideas should be evaluated on their merits, not their supporters. This bill does benefit lobbyists and political advertisers, and may in some cases slow down our process, but like police bodycameras, the transparency is worth the costs.
