Banning products should be a last resort reserved for products that severely harm users and/or others. Machine guns and heroin fall in this category; plastic bags do not. Internalizing the environmental damage from plastic bags would be responsible, and could be effected via a tax, even a high one. For example, I support increasing the cigarette tax this year (Prop 56) and effectively transforming the paper bag fee into a tax (Prop 65). Just as banning gasoline would go too far, so too would banning plastic bags.
