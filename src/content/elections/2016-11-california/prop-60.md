This is a solution in search of a problem; HIV hasn't been transmitted in a porn film in over ten years, and porn stars have regular STD tests. Like prohibition of marijuana and prostitution, this excessive state control would lead to underground activity, which would ultimately be less safe. Theoretical benefits from modeling safe bedroom behavior aren't worth it.
