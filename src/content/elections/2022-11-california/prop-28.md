*Don't divert funds from other priorities to arts education.*

#### Background

Prop 28 requires the state to set aside [about \$1 billion per year](https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=28&year=2022) for arts education in government schools.
It doesn't raise any new revenue, so that money comes out of other state programs: healthcare, housing, other educational programs, and so on.

#### Decision

Passing Prop 28 would constrain the Legislature from budgeting in a way that meets the state's current needs.
Vote no.
