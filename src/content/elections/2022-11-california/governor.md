Newsom is running against Republican State Senator Brian Dahle.
As I wrote in my June guide, Newsom has generally disappointed me; however, he's recently signed critical housing bills AB 2011 (legalize housing on commercial sites) and AB 2097 (legalize parking-free buildings near transit).
He's far more liberal than his Republican challenger.
