*Let Native American tribes and other entities offer sports betting.*

#### Background

Prop 27 covers similar territory to Prop 26, though it allows online sports betting in more places and levies more fees and taxes.
Accordingly, [the Legislative Analyst Office estimates](https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=27&year=2022) that it would raise significantly more revenue than Prop 26:

> Increased state revenues, possibly in the hundreds of millions of dollars but not likely to exceed \$500 million annually. Some revenues would support state regulatory costs, possibly reaching the mid-tens of millions of dollars annually.

85% of the revenues would fund state housing and mental health programs, and the remaining 15% would go to federally recognized tribes in California that do not offer online sports betting.

#### Decision

Props 26 and 27 compete, so if they both pass, the one with the most votes would take effect.
I prefer Prop 26's flexibility by directing revenues to the state general fund, but Prop 27's greater permissiveness and fees generate more economic activity and revenue for government services.
If I could rank them, I would favor Prop 27 over Prop 26, but either would improve upon the prohibitionist status quo, so I recommend voting yes on both.
