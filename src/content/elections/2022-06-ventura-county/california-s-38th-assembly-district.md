Assemblymember Steve Bennett is the only Democrat in the race.
The incumbent faces Republican Cole Brocato and Daniel Wilson, who isn't running with a party affiliation, but whose stances align with the Democratic Socialists of America.
Both Bennett and Wilson strongly urged Congress to enact a national carbon fee-and-dividend policy in the [Citizens' Climate Lobby questionnaire](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/be521693-9b01-41ad-ab11-6e8c538aff0f/page/1knwB?params=%7B%22df4%22:%22include%25EE%2580%25800%25EE%2580%2580IN%25EE%2580%2580California%2520Assembly%2520District%252038%22%7D) (Brocato didn't respond).
Assemblymember Bennett is an inconsistent supporter of housing---he abstained from SB9 and SB10 last year, but voted yes for AB1401--and in the [candidate forum](https://youtu.be/XtjTYaWkMdM) he minimized the need for more market-rate housing, but the others weren't any better.
Bennett is more knowledgeable and experienced, and less socialist, than Wilson.
Re-elect him.
