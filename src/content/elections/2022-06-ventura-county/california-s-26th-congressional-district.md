Representative Julia Brownley is the only Democrat in the race.
The incumbent faces four competitors: three Republicans and one independent, Dave Goodman, who isn't a serious challenger.
Representative Brownley is a pretty standard Democrat; I've wished she would do more, like cosponsoring the [Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act](https://energyinnovationact.org), or at least holding back from supporting the regressive SALT deduction so strongly, but she's a reliable advocate of liberal issues in DC.
