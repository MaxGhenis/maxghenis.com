Chief Deputy Assessor of Ventura County [Keith Taylor](https://www.taylorforassessor.com/) is running against...appraiser (?) [Bradley Coburn](https://www.bradleycoburn.com/).
Their campaign websites show that Taylor is the serious, experienced, endorsed candidate, while Coburn just wants to cut property taxes.
(As a non-policymaking role, I would favor making this an appointed rather than elected position.)
