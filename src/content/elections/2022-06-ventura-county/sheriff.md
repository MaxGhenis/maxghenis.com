Bill Ayub is the incumbent, and his second-in-command, Jim Fryhoff, is running against him.
I watched their debate and read their websites, which suggested the main policy difference has to do with a pension reform Ayub was pushing, against the wishes of the deputy sheriff's union.
The union apparently then recruited and endorsed Fryhoff, along with a bunch of other law enforcement unions.
Don't let cop unions bully the public into paying for broken pension contracts.
Vote for Ayub.
