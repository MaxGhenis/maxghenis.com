Michelle Ascension is the current Assistant County Clerk-Recorder and former City Clerk for Oxnard, and has the endorsement of the current Clerk-Recorder and most elected officials in the county.
The [candidate forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVcvc1j7YSA) revealed that Ascension is the only candidate with relevant experience and knowledge to execute the duties of the office.
Jeff Hargleroad is a former show biz exec, and Bruce Boyer didn't join the forum.

As Ascencion stated in the forum, this is not a policymaking role, which means two things in my view:
1. It shouldn't be an elected office
2. If it is an elected office, voters should elect the most qualified candidate, as an elected body would ideally do when they appoint someone

Do what we should ask the Board of Supervisors or County CEO to do: put the person with the background to execute policy, Michelle Ascencion.
