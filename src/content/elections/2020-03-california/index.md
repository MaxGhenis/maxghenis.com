On Tuesday, California Democrats will play a major role in selecting President Trump's November challenger. They will also join non-Democrats in approving on a bond measure and deciding on hundreds of other races and ballot measures in their local jurisdiction.

While I'm living in Cambridge, Massachusetts through May for graduate school, I'm registered in Oxnard, California, my residence from July through January. Prior to that, I'd been in San Francisco since 2016. I've followed politics in both California locations, so this guide includes suggestions for both my own ballot and San Francisco voters.

My general stances haven't changed substantially compared to my voter guides from prior elections. I vote blue; I believe we need more housing; I support responsible budgeting, unconstrained by set-asides and unsustainable deficits; I worry about climate change and fake remedies to it; I value evidence, economics, and expertise; I like markets; I oppose unnecessary ballot measures; I despise poverty; I love immigration; I want to reward honesty, inclusion, and true democracy. I do my best to tie these stances to my voting positions, and to defend the stances in more detail in the context of the guide.
