This includes races I'm personally voting in (in Oxnard), as well as other races I've researched through Ventura County YIMBY.

See also [endorsements from Ventura County YIMBY](http://vcyimby.org/endorsements).
I was involved in that endorsement process, and mirror all those endorsements here,
including some of the language from our site and the [YIMBY Action text](https://yimbyaction.org/endorsements/ventura-county/).
