Becker is aiming to unseat incumbent Suza Francina.
Francina's responses to the YIMBY questionnaire were generally pro-housing, for example expressing sadness that so many people who work in Ojai commute from other cities, and supporting fourplex legalization.
But she's presided over [extremely slow growth in Ojai](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2019/11/25/ojai-new-apartments-built-first-time-10-years/4191477002/) (where only 15 to 16 new homes are allowed to be built each year), and throughout her campaign has [condemned](https://suzafrancinaforojaicitycouncil.com/f/a-second-opinion-response-to-my-opponent-on-affordable-housing) the sorts of large developments needed to address the housing crisis:
>Developers benefit greatly from the affordable housing law when they build large developments and only a small percentage are actually affordable. Their developments take a ton of water and increase traffic, but don't increase the sustainability, diversity, and resilience of the community in a meaningful way. Advocacy for 100% affordable developments, of small size, accomplishes more than a massive development where only 15% of the units are affordable and 85% are market rate.

Francina also [opposes short-term rentals](https://suzafrancinaforojaicitycouncil.com/f/part-two-on-affordable-housing-draft),
which provide extra income for homeowners and needed extra flexible housing supply---for example,
many of my grad school classmates from outside the US used Airbnb.
There's no reason for short-term rentals to displace long-term residents if more housing is allowed to be built.

Becker, on the other hand, supports housing from all angles, as demonstrated both in her VC YIMBY questionnaire and in a phone call I had with her.

VC YIMBY [endorsed Becker](https://www.vcyimby.org/endorsements#h.kc6jru5tgaf2):
>Becker started off her questionnaire response by saying, "There is a housing crisis. I know, I see it daily...This crisis will not only affect every individual but also our City's financial health, and the health of our businesses. Let's make smart decisions that give Ojai a chance to continue to be livable and healthy." From lobbying Sacramento to allow housing on church property, to proposing housing developments near transit, to advocating reduced fees on low-income housing, Becker has supported housing from many angles, and would bring that perspective to making Ojai more inclusive.
