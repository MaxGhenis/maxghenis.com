VC YIMBY [endorsed Schmidt](https://www.vcyimby.org/endorsements#h.w0ziuawbtuty):
>Schmidt is exceptionally knowledgeable and supportive of all areas of housing and transportation reform, from the history and consequences of exclusionary zoning to the legislation and local actions that can make our communities more safe and affordable. She believes adding housing of all types is the key to affordability, saying in our questionnaire that she is "definitely in support of legalizing residential buildings up to five stories near major transit jobs and in job-rich areas...I also believe that a diversity of affordable housing options mixed in through out the single family home communities...is the right way to go." We agree!
