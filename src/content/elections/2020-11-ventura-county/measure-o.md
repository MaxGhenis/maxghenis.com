Measure O legalizes and taxes the cultivation, processing, distribution, and sale of cannabis.
This honestly shouldn't even be necessary: California voted [by 14 points](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/us/legal-pot-california.html) to legalize recreational cannabis in 2016, and the law took effect on January 1, 2018.
But nearly three years later, many places have still banned it.
Measure O doesn't go far enough--it still restricts locations and imposes onerously high taxes--
but it's a step toward respecting the will of California voters,
that also raises [$3 million](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2020/09/01/study-ventura-county-2020-election-commercial-production-marijuana-initiative/3446372001/) in annual tax revenue
and brings an underground business above board where it can be appropriately regulated.
