[Ayala](https://joeayala.org/) is among five candidates seeking to unseat incumbent [Keith Mashburn](https://www.facebook.com/KeithMashburnforMayor).
Mashburn has opposed housing as mayor, including overseeing an [abhorrent attempt](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2020/03/14/simi-valley-delays-278-unit-apartments-state-says-must-approve/5022750002/) to deny an affordable senior housing development, in defiance of state law.

Ayala was one of two candidates for mayor who filled out the VC YIMBY questionnaire, and he gave the more pro-housing responses.
He also has a strong background and has a solid chance to replace the conservative Mashburn.

VC YIMBY [endorsed Ayala](https://www.vcyimby.org/endorsements#h.mjhqabl7ay8f):

>Ayala, a veteran and union negotiator, is currently running to unseat anti-housing Simi Valley mayor Keith Mashburn.  Having grown up working class, Ayala understands the hardships renters face.  He has stated he is looking to increase the development of missing middle housing to house Simi Valley's workforce, saying in our questionnaire that, "All people need affordable homes where they can feel safe and secure in their community."
