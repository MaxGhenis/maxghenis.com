[James Aragon](https://www.facebook.com/Aragon4Treasurer/), a contract analyst, is running against incumbent
[Phillip Molina](https://www.facebook.com/Phillip-S-Molina-for-Oxnard-Treasurer-171608386581718).
A [VC Star questionnaire](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2020/09/21/incumbent-oxnard-city-treasurer-phil-molina-has-one-challenger-november/5736579002/?fbclid=IwAR0BYtq93ZwQpVXtJps4euLSM1n5Gbhwg98clcLiPO8tXrYnND1NzNK1FNc) and
[League of Women Voters forum](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2020/10/14/election-2020-phil-molina-james-aragon-oxnard-city-treasurer-candidates/5964358002/?fbclid=IwAR3R3s6jlCLpLfU94EDt83KLvBmAlNj14FL_6rXRlp58Ph_vKbKVs8WBoIw) failed to reveal substantial policy
differences between the candidates---if anything, they seem to credit each other with having similar views.
Both are nominally qualified, with MBAs and finance experience.
On a political level, neither is appealing: Aragon is voting for Republican Aaron Starr for City Council,
and one of Molina's few posts on his campaign site is from an "All Lives Matter" protest.

Instead, I'm voting primarily on the relationship with City Hall.
Molina was elected in 2016, and City Council took away some of his job responsibilities after an investigator
identified malfeasance, spurring Measure L which would restore these duties.
Both candidates support L (I'm voting against it).
A new treasurer would ease this toxicity.
