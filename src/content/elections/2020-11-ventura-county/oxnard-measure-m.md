Measure M requires rule alterations for city meetings.
Having attended many such meetings, the problem I've observed is what needs to go to a meeting (rather than being by-right), not whether materials are shared early enough.
This would slow down operations, and isn't fit for voters to decide directly; city council can make these calls.
