Similarly to Loos, [Valencia](https://www.ryanvalencia.org/) is challenging an anti-density incumbent, [Elaine Litster](https://www.facebook.com/elainesimivalleycitycouncil/), on a pro-housing, pro-transit platform that emphasizes workforce housing and homelessness.

Simi Valley needs new leadership (other than Ruth Luevanos): Ayala, Loos, and Valencia will provide it.
