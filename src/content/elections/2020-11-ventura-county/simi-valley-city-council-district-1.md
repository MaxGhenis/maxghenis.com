[Loos](https://www.philloos.com/) is challenging incumbent [Dee Dee Cavanaugh](https://www.votefordeedee.com/).

Cavanaugh has presided over an awful city council that has sought to defy state law in rejecting an affordable senior housing development.
She also made [insulting remarks](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/communities/simi-valley/2020/05/12/report-clears-simi-council-members-race-charges-made-colleague/3106824001/) about a Latina fellow councilmember.
Cavanaugh's website has no housing plan.

Loos, on the other hand, has a [thorough housing page](https://www.philloos.com/housing/) that states his proposed solution to economic stagnation, skyrocketing housing costs, and flat city revenues:
> Mixed-use developments to attract younger workers and spur economic development

> Affordable and attainable housing for young workers, working class families, and seniors on fixed incomes
