Two of eight candidates will fill open city council seats in Thousand Oaks.
Danny Chulack and incumbent [Al Adam](https://www.aladamforcouncil.com/) are the pro-housing options.

Adam has supported the the Thousand Oaks Boulevard Specific Plan, the mixed-use [T.O. Ranch](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/communities/conejo-valley/2020/05/14/thousand-oaks-development-largest-proposed-mixed-use-project-pre-screening/3121022001/) project, and other housing in his tenure.

Chulack had the most pro-housing views of the three candidates who completed the VC YIMBY questionnaire.

Other candidates don't recognize the housing crisis.
[Frank Enderle](https://www.isellrealestate.us/cp/vote/) strongly opposes walkable communities.
[Joel Price](https://www.joelprice4council.com/) "believes cities, not the state, should dictate the character of their community."
(That's code for, "cities should have the power to deny needed housing.")
While [Dan Twedt](https://www.facebook.com/DanTwedt2020/) has followed YIMBY content and cited Henry George's book, *Progress and Poverty*, three times in his [questionnaire](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/38340a3e-2955-4fb8-af07-e28da348b558/page/KE9fB?params=%7B%22df2%22:%22include%25EE%2580%25800%25EE%2580%2580IN%25EE%2580%2580Dan%2520Twedt%252C%2520Thousand%2520Oaks%2520City%2520Council%22%7D) (probably the single most influential book I've read),
he also strongly disagrees with building housing at all levels of affordability, and has unrealistic ideas on improving Thousand Oaks, such as tunneling.

VC YIMBY [endorsed Chulack](https://www.vcyimby.org/endorsements#h.4wgqvy1ci2qu):
>Chulack has made housing a top campaign issue, especially for students, seniors, and people experiencing homelessness. He recognizes that protecting Thousand Oaks's open space is not in conflict with addressing the housing shortage. He said in our questionnaire, "I am committed to building more affordable housing in the city."
