[Zaragoza](https://zaragozaformayor.com/),
who is termed out after serving as county supervisor and previously served on Oxnard city council,
is running against [Deirdre Frank](https://deirdrefrankformayorofoxnard2020.com/),
chair of the Oxnard planning commission,
and [Richard Linares](http://vote4richardlinares.com/).

Zaragoza has [supported housing](https://vcreporter.com/2016/06/redeveloping-fishermans-wharf/) at Fisherman's Wharf as a county supervisor (a project [I advocated](https://medium.com/vcyimby/support-for-oxnard-fishermans-wharf-development-26d5204e9f7c)),
though he also [supported a 2016 measure that extended SOAR through 2050](https://ballotpedia.org/Oxnard,_California,_Extension_of_SOAR_through_2050,_Measure_L_(November_2016));
SOAR prevents farmers from building housing on their agricultural land.
However, his main opponent Deirdre Frank led the planning commission as it denied apartments at the wharf,
and her website's only housing-related content is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSudQQav3kA) of her seven-minute denunciation of the project.

Linares is not running a professional campaign.
His primary occupation appears to be as a [promoter](https://goodhustlers.com/about-us),
and most of his social media content is religious in nature.

VC YIMBY [endorsed Zaragoza](https://www.vcyimby.org/endorsements#h.hsp1rwittnlx):
>A current Ventura County supervisor and former Oxnard councilmember, Zaragoza has considerable experience working on local issues and supporting projects that provide needed housing to the city and county.
