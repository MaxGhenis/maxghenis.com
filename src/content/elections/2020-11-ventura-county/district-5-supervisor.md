Oxnard Mayor Pro Tem [Carmen Ramirez](https://carmen4supervisor.com/) and
Oxnard Mayor [Tim Flynn](https://www.tim4supervisor.com/) are running for the county supervisor seat
vacated by John Zaragoza, who's termed out and running for Oxnard Mayor (I'm voting for him).
Ramirez is simply the more pro-housing choice.
She [advocated forcefully](https://twitter.com/MaxGhenis/status/1197031504490057729) for a homeless shelter.
She supported compliance with a state accessory dwelling unit law, which Flynn wrongly claimed would
[worsen overcrowding](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/2020/07/23/oxnard-housing-real-estate-application-granny-flat-construction/5486652002/) (it would do the opposite).
While both Ramirez and Flynn voted against the [Fisherman's Wharf apartment development](https://medium.com/vcyimby/support-for-oxnard-fishermans-wharf-development-26d5204e9f7c), she has committed to adding housing at the site, unlike Flynn.

Ramirez was also the only candidate to complete the [VC YIMBY questionnaire](http://vcyimby.org/endorsements).
Her pro-housing responses earned our endorsement:

>As Oxnard's Mayor Pro Tem, Ramirez has consistently supported housing projects, accessory dwelling unit streamlining, and homelessness services, and has demonstrated intent to bring inclusive housing policy to the entire county. In our questionnaire, Ramirez said that farmworkers, disabled people, and seniors "are too often priced out and have to live in miserable and overcrowded conditions, which leads to the fraying of our society," and that "we also need to support transportation options that will get people out of their cars and help to avoid the climate changes that are getting worse every day as people still drive gas powered vehicles."
