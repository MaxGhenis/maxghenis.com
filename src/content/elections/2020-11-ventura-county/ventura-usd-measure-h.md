VC YIMBY [endorsed Measure H](https://www.vcyimby.org/endorsements#h.tuf5rd2bufia):
>This four-year renewal of a $59 parcel tax would fund a range of academic programs. We're especially fond of parcel taxes since they tax single family homes more than apartments (apartment complexes are treated as single parcels), making this a pro-housing way to help our children succeed.
