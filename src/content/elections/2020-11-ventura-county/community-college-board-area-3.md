[Stan Mantooth](http://stanmantooth.com), Ventura County Superintendent of Schools,
[Nicole Wall](https://nicole-wall.net/), retired teacher, and
[Joe Ramirez](https://www.ramirez4trustee3.com/), retired college administrator,
are vying for a spot on the Community College Board.

Mantooth and Ramirez are similarly qualified, with leadership and administrative experience in educational institutions, while Wall's campaign emphasizes social justice.
But Ramirez's website includes more policy specifics, such as preparing more people to work in healthcare.
