VC YIMBY [recommended voting No on Measure N](https://www.vcyimby.org/endorsements#h.3ukk4j2akz4p):
>Measure N holds city services hostage on vehicle infrastructure, promising to deny sales tax revenue if pavement standards aren't met. Threatening the city's safety and security by cutting off funding for fire and emergency response is grotesque, especially for the sole purpose of making driving more pleasant.
