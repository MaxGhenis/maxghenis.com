[Halter](https://doughalter.com/) is running to unseat [Christy Weir](https://www.christyweir.com/).
[Dougie Michie](https://dougie4district2.com/) is also running from the right.

Weir is a major NIMBY. From her website:
>Historical buildings should be preserved and renovated to remind us of the importance of Ventura's heritage. New buildings should conform to strict quality and design standards, to enhance the beauty of our natural setting. There should be limits on "high density" and mixed use development to prevent over-urbanization.

Halter and Michie both completed the VC YIMBY candidate questionnaire, and while Michie was generally pro-housing, he also made dog-whistles against "aggressive" homeless people, and promised to "oppose any and all proposals to increase taxeson Ventura's citizens."

Halter is the liberal, pro-housing candidate to remove a NIMBY from power.

VC YIMBY [endorsed Halter](https://www.vcyimby.org/endorsements#h.k7b8akis6z0u):
>Halter deeply understands the causes and consequences of our housing shortage, and supports housing at all levels, especially infill. In our questionnaire, he said, "Affordable housing; infill construction before considering any encroachment on farmland and higher density...are a big part of the solutions we need and my desire to run for office." He has also served the community as a commissioner and board member of several organizations, bringing him the experience, knowledge, and disposition to get more housing built in Ventura.
