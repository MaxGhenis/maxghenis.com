[Madrigal](https://www.facebook.com/electMadrigal/), the incumbent, is running against
[Ronald Arruejo](http://www.arruejoforoxnard.com) and [Aaron Starr](https://www.starrforoxnard.com/).

Madrigal was the only councilmember to vote for the [Fisherman's Wharf development](https://medium.com/vcyimby/support-for-oxnard-fishermans-wharf-development-26d5204e9f7c), though he was also one of two who [voted against a homeless shelter](https://twitter.com/MaxGhenis/status/1197031530188509184).
However, his responses to the VC YIMBY questionnaire were more pro-housing than those from Arruejo, who said "Five stories will not be in keeping with the city's character."

Aaron Starr is a notorious character in Oxnard,
having sponsored four of the five ballot measures this cycle and numerous others in the past.
I'm voting no on all four of his measures, but notably, his Measure N would hold city services hostage on road infrastructure.
He opposes taxes and doesn't mention housing on his website.

VC YIMBY [endorsed Madrigal](https://www.vcyimby.org/endorsements#h.a2dj68qxwm8):
>Madrigal connects housing segregation to school segregation, saying "As a teacher, I see this everyday." As an incumbent, he has shown a commitment to bringing down housing costs, and would continue to do so if re-elected.
