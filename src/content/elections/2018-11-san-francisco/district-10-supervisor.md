District 10 includes the Bayview Hunters Point, Potrero Hill, Dogpatch, and Visitacion Valley neighborhoods, and is currently represented by Malia Cohen. Three leading candidates include Human Rights Commissioner Theo Ellington, artist Tony Kelly, and nonprofit director Shamann Walton.

Only Ellington acknowledges the necessity of additional housing supply, including market-rate housing, in addressing San Francisco's most pressing crisis: exorbitant cost of living. Kelly opposes market-rate development, and Walton's views fall between Ellington and Kelly's.

## Ellington is the pro-housing candidate

San Francisco is the most expensive city on Earth because lots of people want to live here and we don't have enough housing. This problem cannot be solved by public housing alone: we need to build thousands of units of market-rate housing to even make a dent in affordability.

Ellington is the only candidate who unequivocally supports building market-rate housing, and who knows how to do it. As he said in his YIMBY questionnaire:

> In order to address the housing crisis we must increase the overall production of housing. I firmly believe supply and demand is a real thing. I also believe, as stated in the Regional Housing Needs Allocation, the State must apply pressure so all cities partake in providing the additional supply of housing needed to reach our goals. My policy approach will consist of removing barriers from the planning process and identifying creative land-use strategies to build more housing in our city.

He reinforced these by overtly supporting market-rate housing: build more homes for folks at every income level.

The third sentence is especially controversial: Ellington is saying that California should have more power to ensure cities meet housing needs. He's right. Cities routinely approve commercial buildings over housing to generate city funds and avoid diluting incumbents' local voting rights, and this has contributed to California's 4-million-home shortage. State legislation to make zoning more consistent across the state can help, and Ellington supported the strongest such bill, SB 827, which would have legalized apartments near transit.

Ellington also backs up these views with specific policy proposals, such as considering a by-right process for zoning for projects that include a majority of or all affordable housing units. A by-right process is one in which a building that meets all regulations (environmental, safety, etc.) can be built without discretionary review, which often gives neighbors and the planning commission endless opportunity to hold up projects. By-right development would generate more housing more quickly, and is within reach with a pro-housing Board of Supervisors.

Some of his views could suppress housing development, such as pushing for the highest inclusionary percentages possible for all projects (negotiating on each project rather than setting clear rules creates uncertainty for developers) and saying every approved project should avoid displacement at all costs (which can mean losing out on beneficial projects). But overall he is by far the best candidate on housing.

## Kelly opposes market-rate development

Kelly declined to answer the YIMBY questionnaire, but has made clear his opposition to market-rate housing, stating we cannot build our way out of our housing crisis because we are losing too many affordable units to a market that treats housing as a commodity. His website stated: Progress starts with a Board of Supervisors who are independent from luxury condo developers.

Kelly only supports 100% affordable (subsidized) housing, which cannot meet the need. A public bank, central to Kelly's platform, does not remove the drive for investors to earn a return; if San Francisco becomes the investor, we're effectively just using city funds to subsidize that housing.

## Walton supports housing at a high level, but specific policies are less pro-growth

Walton's first sentence in the YIMBY questionnaire is: I'm committed to building thousands of affordable housing units for all income levels over the next 8 years. This seems to support market-rate development. Maximizing affordable units is a far better proposal than maximizing the affordable share. These are sentences Kelly would not utter, and for that Walton is clearly preferable.

However, much of his other views on specific policies would make it harder to build housing: he believes zoning and planning should remain in the hands of local leadership and community, supports a full repeal of Costa Hawkins and more rent control legislation, and while he acknowledges by-right development could be appropriate in specific locations, he believes it would have to occur only on a case-by-case basis. Selecting by-right development on a case-by-case basis negates many of the benefits of by-right development itself.

Aside from housing, Walton's emphasis on local hiring, excluding newcomers from job opportunities, is concerningly nativist.

If elected to the Board of Supervisors, Theo Ellington will advocate for more housing of all types in District 10 and across San Francisco. Tony Kelly will oppose projects that aren't 100 percent subsidized, which in practice means the vast majority of projects. As Supervisor he would worsen the housing shortage that hurts us all, and do so in the name of ideology. Vote Ellington #1 and Walton #2 to prevent that outcome.
