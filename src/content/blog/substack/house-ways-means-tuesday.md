On Friday, May 9, the House Ways & Means Committee released a 28-page committee print detailing proposed individual income tax reforms. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates these changes would reduce revenue by approximately **$4.9 trillion through 2035** compared to current law.

## Proposed tax reforms

The committee print includes several key modifications:

- **TCJA Extension**: Make permanent the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's lower rate schedule, alternative minimum tax structure, and estate tax thresholds
- **Standard Deduction**: Enlarge the standard deduction from 2025-2028 while keeping personal and dependent exemptions repealed
- **Child Tax Credit**: Increase to $2,500 for 2025-2028, then return to indexed $2,000 levels, requiring Social Security Numbers for parents and children
- **Pass-Through Deduction**: Raise the §199A deduction rate to 22 percent

## Missing campaign proposals

Notably absent from the print are several Trump administration campaign pledges:

- State and local tax (SALT) deduction restoration
- Social Security benefits taxation changes
- Tax-free tips
- Overtime pay exclusion
- Auto-loan interest deduction

## The markup process

The committee will proceed as follows:

1. Staff posts an amendment in the nature of a substitute Monday or Tuesday morning
2. Tuesday at 2 p.m. ET, the Committee convenes, adopts the amendment as base text, and considers member amendments
3. The final bill reported at adjournment advances to the House floor

## Prediction markets

Five Manifold Markets track key policy outcomes, with current betting suggesting:

- SALT cap restoration likely, with debate over specific limits
- Social Security tax exemptions considered unlikely
- Tips exclusion deemed improbable
- Overtime exclusion viewed as most unlikely
- Auto-loan interest deduction considered highly improbable
