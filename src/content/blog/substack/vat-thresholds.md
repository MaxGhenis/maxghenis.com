I'm debunking a Telegraph report claiming the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) projected that raising the VAT threshold would increase tax revenues through economic growth effects.

## The misinterpretation

Multiple AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok) incorrectly concluded the policy sits on the profitable side of the Laffer curve, attributing long-run gains to "reduced bunching and stronger business growth."

## What actually happened

The March 2024 HMRC policy paper shows raising the threshold from £85,000 to £90,000 would reduce revenues for four years, then increase them in 2028-29. Crucially, HMRC states: "This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts."

## The critical counterfactual

The revenue increase reflects not growth effects but baseline inflation indexing. The OBR's baseline freezes the threshold at £85,000 until March 2026, then indexes it to RPI inflation. By 2028-29:

- Baseline threshold: £92,000
- Policy threshold: £90,000
- Result: £65 million revenue gain

The £90,000 policy generates revenue simply by staying £2,000 below the inflation-adjusted baseline, not through economic expansion.

## Conclusion

While VAT threshold increases could theoretically boost growth through reduced distortions and administrative burdens, the government's projections incorporate no such effects. The apparent revenue reversal is purely a mechanical artifact of how baselines were constructed.
