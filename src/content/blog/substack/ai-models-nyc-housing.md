I conducted an experiment using six AI models to forecast NYC housing production under two mayoral candidates. All models predicted greater housing supply under Andrew Cuomo compared to Zohran Mamdani.

## Methodology

I created conditional prediction markets on Manifold Markets asking how many housing units NYC would have by 2029 under each candidate's administration. I then provided six AI models with the market text and requested probability distributions:

- OpenAI o3-pro (normal and deep research versions)
- Anthropic Claude 4 Opus (normal and deep research versions)
- Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (normal and deep research versions)

## Key findings

**Housing stock predictions (2029):**
- Cuomo scenario: 3,924,000 homes
- Mamdani scenario: 3,869,000 homes
- Difference: 55,000 more units under Cuomo

**Growth comparison (from 2023 baseline of 3,705,000 homes):**
- Cuomo growth: 219,000 units (5.91%)
- Mamdani growth: 164,000 units (4.43%)
- **Result: 34% more growth under Cuomo**

When adjusting for baseline growth through 2026, models projected 50% greater housing production under Cuomo.

## Model variation

Model predictions differed significantly:
- OpenAI o3-pro without Deep Research: 75,000 unit advantage for Cuomo
- OpenAI o3-pro with Deep Research: 36,000 unit advantage
- Google Gemini 2.5 Pro projected larger differentials than Anthropic Claude 4 Opus

## Factors identified

**General growth drivers:**
- Existing 421-a pipeline projects
- 1.4% vacancy rate (lowest since 1968)
- City of Yes zoning reforms (~5,500 units/year)
- Expected declining interest rates

**Cuomo-specific factors:**
- 467-m office conversion incentive
- Real estate industry relationships
- Proposed $5 billion capital fund

**Mamdani-specific factors:**
- 200,000 public units over 10 years
- Rent freeze on stabilized units
- Requires state approval for $70 billion financing

## Conclusion

Quantitative forecasting exercises prompt AI models to identify relevant evidence and recognize important magnitude differences in policy outcomes.
