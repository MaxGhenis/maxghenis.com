As CEO of PolicyEngine, leadership responsibilities have reduced my programming time, but I maintained 3,721 GitHub contributions throughout 2024, spanning collaborative work, third-party contributions, and personal projects.

## Key projects

### CodeStitch

A tool that stitches GitHub repos, PRs, and issues into single text files to facilitate sharing code context with AI assistants. The application evolved from a Streamlit prototype to a React-based solution in December, addressing the challenge of context limitations when seeking AI programming help.

### PR Improver

An application suggesting pull request improvements using language models and the GitHub API. It compares suggestions against contributor guidelines in repositories. Currently limited to PolicyEngine repositories due to operational costs, with plans to expand support for other repos where users can provide their own API keys.

### OEWS Explorer

A Streamlit application helping users explore Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics by occupation and geography. Originally developed to support PolicyEngine's NSF grant application, it's also useful for compensation research.

### Personal website

A refreshed version of maxghenis.com built with React, offering a cleaner, more maintainable platform for sharing my work and writing.

## Impact of AI tools

AI has transformed programming more than any field, enabling faster ideation, prototyping, and building. Claude and similar tools serve as collaborative partners in the development process, helping with architectural decisions, edge case discovery, and framework learning.

## Conclusion

I encourage developers and curious leaders to prioritize coding projects. AI tools make this an ideal time to build innovative solutions.
