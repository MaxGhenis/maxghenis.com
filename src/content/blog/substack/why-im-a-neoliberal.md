I identify as a neoliberal because I believe in evidence-based policy, free markets with smart regulations, strong social safety nets, and global cooperation. This isn't about defending the status quo—it's about supporting policies that actually work to reduce poverty and expand opportunity.

Key tenets I embrace:
- **Evidence over ideology**: Policy should be guided by data and research, not dogma
- **Markets work, mostly**: Free markets are powerful engines of prosperity, but they need guardrails
- **Safety nets matter**: A strong social safety net helps people take risks and recover from setbacks
- **Immigration is good**: More open borders lead to more prosperity for everyone
- **Housing abundance**: We need to build more housing to make cities affordable
- **Carbon pricing**: The best way to address climate change is to price carbon
