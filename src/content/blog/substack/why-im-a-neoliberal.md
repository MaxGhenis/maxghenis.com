I'm competing in the Neoliberal Twitter account's annual bracket competition, which gives me an opportunity to explain my commitment to neoliberal ideology. I position neoliberalism as a pragmatic, evidence-based approach to solving pressing policy challenges through market mechanisms and strategic government intervention.

## What is neoliberalism?

Neoliberalism has been mischaracterized as selfish or warmongering. Instead, it's rooted in liberal values, emphasizing evidence-based policymaking and practical solutions. Key tenets include deregulation of housing and labor markets, carbon pricing, immigration, globalization, and a robust social safety net.

## Housing deregulation (YIMBYism)

I advocate for legalizing apartment construction, particularly dense infill housing near jobs and transit. Overregulated land use restricts freedom of movement, impedes economic growth, and harms the environment.

My activism includes:
- Joining YIMBY advocacy in San Francisco (2016)
- Campaigning for YIMBY pioneer Sonja Trauss's supervisor campaign (2018)
- Co-founding YIMBY Neoliberal organization (2018)
- Creating Ventura County YIMBY (2019), which gained over 1,500 followers

## Carbon pricing

Carbon taxation is the key ingredient for cutting carbon emissions. The IPCC identifies carbon pricing as crucial for cost-effective climate mitigation, and studies worldwide demonstrate its effectiveness.

Carbon pricing enjoys broad support: average net favorability across 18 polls since 2015 reached +33 percentage points. Most developed nations price carbon; the U.S. and Australia remain exceptions.

My contributions:
- Joined Citizens' Climate Lobby (2018)
- Led my local chapter and became California state coordinator
- Researched carbon dividends professionally
- Co-founded "Save the Gas Tax" campaign (2022) with 15 environmental organizations

## Social safety net

Economic growth alone cannot guarantee minimum living standards for non-workers or address perverse incentives in current welfare systems. I advocate for:

- Universal child allowances
- Cash assistance over in-kind benefits
- Universal basic income (UBI) as the logical endpoint

I founded the **UBI Center**, conducting quantitative policy analysis, and co-founded **PolicyEngine**, a nonprofit technology platform enabling citizens to understand tax and benefit policy impacts. Means-testing creates administrative bloat and extreme marginal tax rates for low-income households.

## Conclusion

I'm an "extreme liberal" seeking the most effective policy solutions: address poverty through direct cash transfers, housing affordability through legalization rather than government management, and pollution through market-based pricing mechanisms. These neoliberal policies are transformative when combined.
