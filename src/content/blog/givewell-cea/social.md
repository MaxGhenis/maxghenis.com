GiveWell's CEA spreadsheet has guided my giving since 2017. I finally built an interactive version covering all 6 top charities — edit any parameter and see how rankings change across 51 country combinations.

GiveWell's cost-effectiveness spreadsheet has guided my giving since 2017. When I first dug into it, I was amazed — every parameter sourced, every assumption explicit. That concept of open computational infrastructure eventually inspired me to build PolicyEngine.

GiveWell's cost-effectiveness analysis has guided my giving for almost a decade. When I first dug into their spreadsheets in 2017, I was amazed by the depth — every parameter sourced, every assumption explicit, every step auditable. A public good built on radical transparency. That concept of open computational infrastructure eventually inspired me to build PolicyEngine.

I finally built an interactive version of all six GiveWell top charity models. You can:
- Edit any input (costs, mortality rates, effect sizes, adjustment factors)
- Adjust moral weights by age bracket
- Run sensitivity analysis to find crossover points between charities

I verified 46 of 51 charity/country results against GiveWell's November 2025 spreadsheets — all match within floating-point precision.

Some observations from the replication: the benchmark denominators differ across GiveWell's spreadsheets, and counterfactual coverage drives most within-charity variation — Helen Keller in Niger scores 79x the benchmark while Cote d'Ivoire scores 6x.
