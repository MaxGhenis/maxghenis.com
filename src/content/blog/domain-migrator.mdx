## Why Cloudflare?

I'm consolidating all my domains to Cloudflare for several reasons:

- **At-cost pricing** - Cloudflare charges wholesale prices with no markup. Domain renewals are typically $2-5 cheaper per year than GoDaddy or Squarespace.
- **Free DNS** - Fast, reliable DNS with DDoS protection included
- **Free SSL** - Automatic HTTPS for all domains
- **Email routing** - Free email forwarding without needing a separate service
- **No upsells** - Clean interface without constant attempts to sell you add-ons
- **API access** - Programmatic control over DNS and other settings

Currently Domain Migrator only supports Cloudflare as the destination, but I could add other registrars (GoDaddy, Squarespace, Namecheap, Porkbun, etc.) in the future if there's demand.

## The tedium of domain transfers

Transferring domains between registrars is one of the most tedious tasks in web administration. Each domain requires:

1. Unlocking the domain at the source registrar
2. Getting an authorization (EPP) code
3. Adding the domain to the new registrar
4. Selecting a plan
5. Copying the new nameservers
6. Updating nameservers at the source registrar
7. Waiting for propagation

Multiply this by 8 domains and you're looking at hours of clicking through slow web interfaces.

I built **Domain Migrator** to automate this entire workflow.

## The problem with existing tools

I researched existing options before building this:

**Registrar bulk transfer tools** - [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/domains/bulk-domain-transfer), [Dynadot](https://www.dynadot.com/domain/bulk-transfer), and others offer bulk transfer *into* their platform. But they still require you to manually:
- Unlock each domain at your current registrar
- Copy auth codes one by one
- Paste them into the bulk transfer form

**Cloudflare API scripts** - [Centmin Mod's blog](https://blog.centminmod.com/2021/03/04/2333/how-to-bulk-domain-transfer-to-cloudflare-registrar-and-save-on-domain-renewal-costs/) shows bash scripts for bulk transfers using Cloudflare's API. But these still require manually gathering auth codes first. And the [Cloudflare API doesn't support API tokens](https://blog.centminmod.com/2021/02/28/2310/how-to-bulk-domain-transfer-out-from-cloudflare-registrar-via-cloudflare-api/) for registrar operations—you need your global API key.

**No end-to-end solution** - I couldn't find any tool that automates the *entire* workflow from source registrar to destination. The bottleneck is always "get your auth codes manually first."

## How Domain Migrator works

Domain Migrator is a Chrome extension that:

1. **Scans your registrar** - Navigate to GoDaddy or Squarespace, click import, and it finds all your domains
2. **Gets auth codes automatically** - Navigates to each domain's transfer page and extracts the authorization code
3. **Adds to Cloudflare** - Opens Cloudflare, adds the domain, selects the free plan
4. **Copies nameservers** - Extracts the assigned Cloudflare nameservers
5. **Updates the source** - Goes back to GoDaddy/Squarespace and updates the nameservers

All while showing progress in a status bar:

```
✓ Get auth code → ✓ Add to Cloudflare → ✓ Select plan → ● Get nameservers → ○ Update nameservers → ○ Done
```

## Technical challenges

Building this taught me a lot about browser automation in 2026:

**SPA navigation** - Both GoDaddy and Cloudflare are single-page apps. The URL changes but the page doesn't fully reload. I had to use MutationObserver to detect navigation and reinitialize the content scripts.

**React input handling** - GoDaddy uses React, which has its own synthetic event system. Simply setting `input.value` doesn't trigger React's state updates. I had to use the native HTMLInputElement value setter and dispatch multiple event types.

**2FA interruptions** - GoDaddy sometimes prompts for 2FA mid-flow. The extension detects this, pauses, and waits for the user to complete verification before resuming.

**Error recovery** - Domains can have "pending events" that block nameserver changes. The extension detects these states and handles them gracefully.

## Completion verification

Each domain tracks three pieces of data:
- `authCode` - The EPP authorization code
- `cloudflareAdded` - Whether it's been added to Cloudflare
- `nameservers.cloudflare` - The assigned Cloudflare nameservers

A domain is only marked complete when all three exist AND the nameserver update succeeds at the source registrar.

## Try it

The extension is open source: [github.com/maxghenis/domain-migrator](https://github.com/maxghenis/domain-migrator)

To install:
1. Clone the repo
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the repo folder

Then navigate to your GoDaddy or Squarespace domain portfolio and click the extension icon to start.

## What's next

- **More registrars** - Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.
- **Cloudflare API integration** - Use the API where possible instead of browser automation
- **Better error handling** - More graceful recovery from edge cases
- **Firefox support** - Port to Firefox extension APIs
