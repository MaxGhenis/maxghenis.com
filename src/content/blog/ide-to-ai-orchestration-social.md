# Social posts for "From IDE to AI orchestration"

## X/Twitter (single post)

Claude Code's creator hasn't written a line of code himself in a month. 259 PRs, 497 commits, 40k lines—all Claude.

I've been working the same way since October. Here's why I expect to abandon my IDE entirely this month: [link]

1/ The shift from "coding" to "orchestrating AI agents" is happening faster than I expected.

Claude Code's creator runs 5-10 Claude instances in parallel. I do the same with TerminalGrid. Neither of us writes code anymore.

2/ 2025's tool launches tell the story:
• Feb: Claude Code (terminal)
• May: OpenAI Codex (cloud)
• Nov: Google Antigravity ("Manager view")
• Nov: Claude Code in Desktop
• Jan: Local Claude Code in Desktop

3/ The pattern for dev tooling: ship fast, expect obsolescence. Frontier labs are moving too quickly.

But that frees us to focus on what matters—health, poverty, governance, the environment.

I haven't touched my code editor in months. VS Code is just a shell for Claude Code terminals now.

Boris Cherny, who created Claude Code, recently shared that 100% of his contributions to Claude Code were written by Claude Code itself. 259 PRs in 30 days. Every line.

This month I expect to abandon VS Code entirely for Claude Desktop. The "Manager view" paradigm—orchestrating AI agents instead of writing code—is becoming the default.

But here's the thing: developer tools built to improve AI coding have a short shelf life. Frontier labs are moving too fast.

The real opportunity? Applying AI to problems that actually matter. Health, poverty, governance, the environment. If you can ship in days what used to take months, you can tackle things that were previously out of reach.

Claude Code's creator: 259 PRs last month, every line written by Claude.

I've been working the same way since October—5-10 Claude instances in parallel, no code editor.

The shift from coding to orchestrating AI agents is here. And it frees us to focus on problems that actually matter.
