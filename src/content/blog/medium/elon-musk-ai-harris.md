I conducted research using OpenAI and Grok (xAI) models to forecast economic, environmental, and poverty outcomes under Harris vs. Trump presidencies. The results were striking: even Elon Musk's own AI predicted Americans would be better off under Harris.

Key findings:
- xAI's Grok model predicted $800 higher per-capita income under Harris
- OpenAI models showed similar pro-Harris economic forecasts
- Environmental and poverty metrics also favored Harris across models
- This research highlights how AI reasoning can inform political analysis
