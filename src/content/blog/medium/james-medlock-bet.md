Our free tax calculator helped determine Balaji Srinivasan's $500,000 payments to Medlock and GiveDirectly following the famous Bitcoin bet. This post explains how we calculated the after-tax implications.

The bet and its resolution:
- Balaji bet $1 million that Bitcoin would hit $1M within 90 days
- James Medlock took the other side of the bet
- When Balaji conceded early, our calculator helped structure the payout
- $500,000 went to Medlock and $500,000 went to GiveDirectly
