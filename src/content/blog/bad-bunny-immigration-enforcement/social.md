Bad Bunny named 24 countries at the Super Bowl halftime show and said "God bless America" — meaning the continent, not just the US.

I looked at the data: 53% of US immigrants come from the Americas, but 93% of ICE arrests involve nationals from those same countries.

Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show last night named every country in the Americas. I looked at what the data says.

Key findings from Census, ICE, and FOIA data:

- 53% of the 50.2M foreign-born people in the US come from other countries in the Americas (ACS 2024)
- 93% of ICE arrests in 2025 involved nationals from those same countries (UC Berkeley Deportation Data Project)
- 45 million people speak Spanish at home — 61% of all non-English speakers
- Operation Metro Surge in Minneapolis, framed around the Somali community, led to 3,000+ arrests — Mexico and Laos were the top nationalities in DHS-released data, with Somalia third
