Last night, Bad Bunny performed the [first primarily Spanish-language Super Bowl halftime show](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bad-bunny-super-bowl-performance-1235513007/) in history. At the end, holding a football that read "Together, we are America," he said "God bless America" and then [named every country and territory in the American continent](https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/breaking-news/article/bad-bunny-echoes-grammy-message-with-super-bowl-halftime-show-together-we-are-america-015121748.html): Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti, the United States, Canada, and the US territory of Puerto Rico. Performers carried each flag behind him.

The performance reached an estimated [130 million viewers](https://variety.com/2026/music/news/bad-bunny-super-bowl-lady-gaga-real-wedding-ceremony-1236656381/). The gesture drew both [praise](https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/breaking-news/article/bad-bunny-echoes-grammy-message-with-super-bowl-halftime-show-together-we-are-america-015121748.html) and [criticism](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bad-bunnys-polarizing-super-bowl-halftime-show-felt-like-slap-america). Here's what the data shows about immigration from the Americas and current enforcement patterns.

## Most US immigrants come from the Americas

**53%** of the roughly 50 million foreign-born people in the United States come from other countries and territories in the American continent, according to [2024 American Community Survey](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2024.B05006) data:

| Region | Share of US foreign-born |
|---|---|
| Mexico | 22.2% |
| Caribbean | 10.5% |
| Central America | 9.1% |
| South America | 9.6% |
| Canada | 1.6% |
| **Total Americas** | **53.0%** |
| Asia | 28.1% |
| Europe | 9.7% |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | 5.0% |
| Middle East / North Africa | 3.6% |

Every country Bad Bunny named on that stage falls within the Americas share of this breakdown.

## Spanish is the most common non-English language

Bad Bunny performed entirely in Spanish. Spanish is the most common non-English language in the United States, [spoken at home by about 45 million people](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2024.S1601), about 14% of the US population. Of the 74 million people who speak a non-English language at home, **61% speak Spanish**, per [2024 ACS data](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2024.S1601).

Congress has never passed a law designating an official language, though an [executive order in March 2025](https://www.usa.gov/official-language-of-us) designated English as the official language. Spanish has been spoken continuously in what is now the US [since the 1500s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language_in_the_United_States), predating the first permanent English settlement at Jamestown in 1607.

## ICE enforcement is concentrated in the Americas

While the foreign-born population is 53% from the Americas, ICE enforcement skews more heavily toward those countries.

[Official ICE data](https://www.ice.gov/statistics) shows that **98-99% of ICE administrative arrests** from FY2021 through Q1 FY2025 involved people from other countries in the Americas. The [UC Berkeley Deportation Data Project](https://deportationdata.org), which publishes record-level FOIA'd arrest data, allows a more granular look at the current administration. From January 20 to October 15, 2025, of 220,931 arrests:

| Region | Arrests | Share |
|---|---|---|
| Americas (total) | 204,528 | 92.6% |
| Latin America | 202,795 | 91.8% |
| Non-Americas | 16,403 | 7.4% |

The top countries of citizenship:

| Country | Arrests | Share |
|---|---|---|
| Mexico | 85,363 | 38.6% |
| Guatemala | 31,231 | 14.1% |
| Honduras | 24,296 | 11.0% |
| Venezuela | 14,606 | 6.6% |
| El Salvador | 10,487 | 4.7% |
| Colombia | 10,194 | 4.6% |
| Ecuador | 8,802 | 4.0% |

A [UCLA Luskin study](https://knowledge.luskin.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Unseen_Latino-Ice-Arrests-Surge-Under-Trump_20251027.pdf) found that about 90% of ICE arrests during the first six months of Trump's second term involved nationals of Latin American countries, using the same Berkeley FOIA data.

This concentration likely reflects the composition of the unauthorized population, which [skews more heavily Latin American](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states) than the foreign-born population as a whole, as well as geographic proximity and enforcement priorities.

## Operation Metro Surge in Minnesota

In December 2025, DHS launched [Operation Metro Surge](https://www.britannica.com/event/2025-26-Minnesota-ICE-Deployment) in Minneapolis, which it called the largest immigration enforcement operation ever, [deploying up to 2,000 federal agents](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/live-updates/ice-somali-immigrants-minneapolis-st-paul/) to the Twin Cities.

DHS said the operation focused on fraud in the Somali-American community. Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the US — roughly [84,000 people in the Twin Cities alone](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/5-things-to-know-about-the-somali-community-in-minnesota-after-trumps-attacks). Of those, nearly **58% were born in the United States**, and of the foreign-born Somalis in Minnesota, **87% are naturalized US citizens**, according to [Census data reported by PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/5-things-to-know-about-the-somali-community-in-minnesota-after-trumps-attacks).

Key outcomes of the operation:

- **3,000+ people arrested** as of January 19, 2026, per [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2026/01/19/ice-continues-remove-worst-worst-minneapolis-streets-dhs-law-enforcement-marks-3000)
- **23 arrestees were from Somalia**, while the operation's stated focus was on Somali fraud ([Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/event/2025-26-Minnesota-ICE-Deployment)). Nationally, 118 of 220,931 ICE arrests (0.05%) from January 20 to October 15, 2025 involved Somali nationals, per the [UC Berkeley Deportation Data Project](https://deportationdata.org)
- About **5% of arrestees had violent criminal records** ([Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/event/2025-26-Minnesota-ICE-Deployment))
- **Two US citizens were killed** by federal agents during the operation: Renee Good and Alex Pretti ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/minneapolis-trump-immigration-ice-border-patrol-arrests-protests-shootings/))
- **50,000 people** gathered on January 23 for a statewide general strike in protest ([Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/event/2025-26-Minnesota-ICE-Deployment))

[Sahan Journal reported](https://sahanjournal.com/immigration/immigration-enforcement-somali-community-impact/) effects on daily life in affected communities, including residents skipping medical appointments, reduced mosque attendance, and hundreds of businesses closing. Minnesota and the Twin Cities [filed a federal lawsuit against DHS](https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2026/docs/00190_DHS_Complaint.pdf).

## Summary

A majority of foreign-born people in the United States — 53% — come from other countries in the Americas. ICE enforcement is even more concentrated, with over 92% of arrests in 2025 involving nationals of countries in the Western Hemisphere. The largest enforcement operation, in Minnesota, was framed around the Somali community but resulted in over 3,000 arrests across nationalities.

Bad Bunny's halftime show put a spotlight on the hemispheric connections between the US and the rest of the Americas. The immigration and enforcement data provide context for the scale of those connections.
