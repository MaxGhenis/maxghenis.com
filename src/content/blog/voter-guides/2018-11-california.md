## No on Proposition 6

Proposition 6 would repeal last year's gas tax and vehicle fee, which generates over $5 billion per year for transportation infrastructure. It would also ban the legislature from enacting future gas tax increases without a ballot measure.

Projects funded by the Road Repair and Accountability Act (RRAA) improve the reliability and effectiveness of California's transportation networks, investing largely in vehicle infrastructure but also in multimodal transport like biking and walking projects. Funding these improvements with taxes on gas and vehicles isn't just logical, it would make a major dent in climate change goals.

### Gas taxes have many benefits

By 2019, RRAA would increase the gas tax by $0.19/gallon, from $0.28 to $0.47, and by a similar amount for diesel. A 2009 paper estimated that "a 10 cent per gallon increase in the gasoline tax would reduce carbon emissions from vehicles in the United States by about 1.5%." RRAA can therefore be expected to reduce California carbon emissions by 2.8 percent.

As 41 percent of California's greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation, RRAA's gas tax alone may be reducing California's GHGs by 1.2 percent. RRAA's vehicle registration fee of $25 to $175 (depending on the value of the vehicle) amplifies this effect by further disincentivizing car usage.

According to data from the OECD, the average gas tax rate among the 34 advanced economies is $2.62 per gallon. In fact, the U.S.'s gas tax is the second lowest (Mexico is the only country without a gas tax) and has a rate less than half of that of the next highest country, Canada, which has a rate of $1.25 per gallon.

A 2015 study also shows that gas taxes can make us safer, finding "a 10.0% increase in gasoline prices corresponded with a 1.5% decrease in traffic crashes per capita." With average California gas prices now at $3.81/gallon, RRAA's $0.19 tax raises prices by 5 percent, for a corresponding 0.75 percent decrease in crashes, or 22 deaths averted each year.

Gas taxes are good for foreign policy, too. Reducing oil demand gives less power to petrostates like US-attacking Russia and journalist-murdering Saudi Arabia.

Finally, reducing car dependence makes more room on public land for humans. Even in urban areas like San Francisco, many blocks give space to free parking, but not protected bike lanes or wider sidewalks; new housing developments carry parking requirements, taking space from housing; and neighbors block train stations and colleges from building housing instead of parking lots. Taxing gas and vehicle registrations reduces overall demand for cars and parking, which can enable us to more quickly address our poverty-inducing 4-million home shortage.

### RRAA projects are valuable

Even if its $5 billion were thrown into the bay, RRAA's taxes would be worth levying. But the money it generates funds critical infrastructure that offsets part of its costs and sets the stage for alternative transportation.

The largest single expenditure is $1.2 billion for highway maintenance and repair, helping the people it taxes. A 2015 study found that San Francisco's poor road conditions cost drivers $500 per year in extra maintenance, compared to the national average.

Most of the remaining funding also goes to vehicle-related transportation projects, compensating for the taxes, which are already progressive by taxing more expensive registrations higher. The $100 million for biking and walking projects in a small way helps fight climate change more by making alternative transportation more compelling.

From the taxes to the projects funded, RRAA puts California on the path to a greener, safer future. **Vote no on Prop 6** to keep its wheels rolling.

## No on Proposition 10

Imagine San Francisco were considering a $400 million per year tax on rents, with proceeds distributed as a rental subsidy. The city would structure the tax to be highest for renters who most recently moved into their homes, and structure the subsidy to be highest for people who have been in their homes longest, and for those with the most expensive homes.

Such a law would be roundly criticized as anti-immigrant and anti-young, and we would question why it attempts to neither explicitly tax the rich nor give to the poor. For such an enormous tax, why forgo a progressive policy design?

Yet this is exactly the law San Francisco has had in place since 1994: you might know it as rent control, which limits annual rent increases. That $400 million comes from a 2017 Stanford study, which found that rent control reduced rents by about that much for incumbents while raising market rents by a similar amount.

In November, Californians will vote on Prop 10, which would allow cities to double down on this policy. Doing so would disadvantage immigrants, young people, and the economy. Prop 10 would give cities virtually limitless power over rent control, enabling them to block development amid the state's worst housing shortage. The state should instead make housing affordable for everyone by ensuring more of it gets built and providing financial assistance to the most housing-insecure.

### What are rent control and Costa-Hawkins?

If it passes in November, Prop 10 would repeal the 1995 Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which limits the types of rent control laws a city can impose. Under Costa-Hawkins, rent control cannot apply to single-family homes, condos, and units built after the earlier of 1995 or the city's passage of their rent control (for example, 1979 in San Francisco). Costa-Hawkins also prohibits cities from limiting rent increases after a tenant moves out of their unit (such rent increase limitations are known as vacancy control).

Repealing Costa-Hawkins would enable cities like San Francisco to enact vacancy control and greatly expand rent control, potentially to all new buildings, single-family homes, and condos.

That annual $400 million tax on newcomers would skyrocket, and based on other research we could also expect:

- Fewer rental units (the Stanford paper estimated a 6 percent drop)
- Lower-quality rental units (in polls from 1992 and 2012, over 90 percent of economists assert that rent control has not had a positive impact on the amount and quality of affordable rental housing)
- More homelessness
- Longer commutes (creating pollution) and fewer people living where they want to live

The most tragic damage could be the least visible: people shut out of economic opportunity due to high new rents in vibrant areas. These people may be in Stockton, West Virginia, or Mexico, and even if they believe they could improve their lives moving to Los Angeles or the Bay Area, they might never try. These missed opportunities don't show up in local rent and income statistics, but Costa-Hawkins reduces their numbers behind the scenes.

### But this just gives cities options, what's wrong with that?

Cities' land use decisions don't operate in a vacuum. When California has the 2nd-fewest housing units per capita of any state and needs 4 million homes to escape its shortage, and cities like Beverly Hills plan only 0.1 percent growth per year, Sacramento would be abdicating its responsibility by leaving housing decisions to local control.

Repealing Costa-Hawkins would undermine any state legislation to address the housing crisis. If a second version of SB 827 passes next year, cities could effectively evade it by passing extreme rent control laws, such as rent and vacancy control on new construction. They could even use it as a threat against developers seeking protection behind state law, or against Sacramento's efforts to enact new state laws.

> "Without Costa-Hawkins I'm concerned we'll have cities that use rent control as a de facto ban on new housing."
> — David Garcia, Policy Director, UC Berkeley Terner Center for Housing Innovation

### If not rent control, how can we achieve its goals?

Rent control is motivated by the noble goal of minimizing displacement of longtime residents, which can tear at the fabric of a community and uproot lives. But reducing displacement doesn't need to come at the expense of newcomers. We can do it in targeted ways to ensure we're helping people who need the help, rather than the many (even disproportionately) high-income people who benefit from rent control.

Building more housing is necessary but not sufficient. If we built enough such that market rents only increased by 2 percent a year, it would be as if everyone had rent control, without the problems created by rent control laws.

The most prominent alternative is below-market-rate (BMR) housing, whether that's publicly-owned or private per inclusionary zoning requirements. BMR targets low-income renters, but its limited supply forces lotteries, demeaning application forms, and years-long waitlists.

Section 8 housing vouchers are also means-tested, and don't force renters to move. In theory, the voucher values could adapt based on available funds and qualifying households; in practice, the values are fixed, meaning they too require lotteries when demand exceeds supply.

An ideal solution would guarantee a subsidy to low-income people, without byzantine requirements. The tax code is a natural place to do this, as the place where households already provide robust income reports. Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) just introduced the Rent Relief Act of 2018, a refundable tax credit for individuals spending over 30 percent of gross income on rent. California could also bolster its own renters credit, and individual cities could create their own.

When California cities started implementing rent control and vacancy control in the 1970s, they were driven by good intent to keep housing affordable. Costa-Hawkins reined it in to avoid risky expansions that would be difficult to reverse.

The past 20 years of rent control evidence supports Costa-Hawkins. Rent control provides overt benefits to some, at the severe and hidden expense to many. Voters comfortable with that trade-off should still be concerned about giving cities total power over rent control, given their history of shirking responsibility to build badly-needed housing.

In November, we should **reject Prop 10** and get to work on better anti-displacement policies.
