The 2022 general election is on Tuesday, November 8.

## BERT PERELLO for Oxnard City Council, District 1

Bert is the incumbent.
He's not incredibly pro-housing, but he has supported some recent projects and was the only member to vote against the [extreme rent control law](https://maxghenis.medium.com/oxnards-rent-control-proposal-would-do-more-harm-than-good-4810a1a6f45).
His main competition is from NIMBY Douglas Partello.

## GABE TERAN for Oxnard City Council, District 2

Gabe is running for re-election.
He's been a major YIMBY ally, and [we endorsed him](https://vcyimby.org/endorsements) for the third time.
His main opponent is Tai Hartley, who led the NIMBY opposition to Riverpark's rezoning (which Gabe supported).

## VANESSA BENITEZ VALDEZ for Calleguas Municipal Water District, Division 4

Valdez and Thibault Robert are running to replace [Andres Santamaria](https://www.calleguas.com/about-calleguas-municipal-water-district/board-of-directors-details.asp?idBio=4).
I couldn't find any information on either candidate, but I could at least verify with Google that Valdez is a real person.
I found nothing on Robert.
The Greater Oxnard Organization of Democrats also [endorsed Valdez](https://greateroxnarddemocrats.com/voting-guide/), but didn't provide a rationale (for her or any other candidate; also no questionnaire responses).

## NO on Measure C

Measure C would strengthen Oxnard's term limits.
Research suggests that [term limits do not achieve their intended goals](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/01/18/five-reasons-to-oppose-congressional-term-limits/), and may worsen policymaking by keeping experienced leaders out of office.

## YES on Measure I

Measure I is a school bond.
School funding and property taxes are good; school bonds do both.

## JULIA BROWNLEY for U.S. Congress, District 26

Brownley is the Democrat.

## STEVE BENNETT for State Assembly, District 38

Bennett is generally disappointing on housing, but he's the Democrat and therefore likely to be better than his opponent, Republican Cole Brocato.

## YES for all justices

This is a silly process.
