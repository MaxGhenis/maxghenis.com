**Post 1:**
Dario Amodei just published a 20,000-word essay predicting AI could displace half of entry-level white collar jobs within 5 years.

It raises a question I think about constantly: do we have the policy infrastructure to respond?

**Post 2:**
Traditional policy analysis takes months. CBO scores bills weeks after introduction. Revisions happen. Repeat.

If AI disrupts labor markets on a 1-5 year timeline, that gap becomes dangerous.

**Post 3:**
If unemployment doubles, policymakers need fast answers:

• What happens to poverty rates?
• How much would expanding UI/SNAP/EITC cost?
• Which reforms reach the most affected households?

These take government agencies months or years to model.

**Post 4:**
There's an irony: the same AI that might displace workers can accelerate policy response.

But only if the underlying models exist. AI can't accelerate infrastructure nobody has built.

**Post 5:**
I don't know if Amodei's specific predictions are right. But the broader point stands: if AI change happens fast, policy response capacity needs to be ready in advance.

## LinkedIn Article intro

Dario Amodei just published a 20,000-word essay predicting AI will displace half of entry-level white collar jobs within five years—"much broader and faster" than previous technological transitions.

It raises a question I think about constantly: do we have the policy infrastructure to respond?

Traditional policy analysis moves slowly. A bill gets introduced, CBO scores it weeks later, revisions happen. If AI disrupts labor markets on a 1-5 year timeline, that gap becomes dangerous.

This is part of why I've spent the last few years building PolicyEngine. But the broader point isn't about any one tool—it's that policy response capacity needs to exist before crises, not during them.
