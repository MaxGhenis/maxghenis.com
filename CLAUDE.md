# maxghenis.com

Personal website built with Astro.

## Style guide

**CRITICAL: Use sentence case for all headings** - only capitalize the first word and proper nouns.

- ✅ "How it compares to other tools"
- ❌ "How It Compares to Other Tools"

**Colons in titles**: Capitalize the first word after a colon (it's a subtitle).

- ✅ "TerminalGrid: Turn VS Code into a Claude Code superterminal"
- ❌ "TerminalGrid: turn VS Code into a Claude Code superterminal"

**Active voice**: Prefer active voice over passive. Put the actor first.

- ✅ "Anthropic launches Claude Code" / "Google releases Antigravity"
- ❌ "Claude Code was launched" / "Antigravity has been released"
- ✅ "I built this tool" / "The model generates code"
- ❌ "This tool was built" / "Code is generated by the model"

This applies to blog post titles, section headings, page titles, and body text.

**No paywalled sources**: All links should be freely accessible. Use official announcements, free surveys, or archive.is links instead of paywalled articles.

## Structure

- `src/content/blog/` - Blog posts (markdown with frontmatter)
- `src/pages/` - Astro pages (projects, cv, rambar, terminalgrid, etc.)
- `src/components/` - Reusable components (Header, Footer, BaseHead)
- `public/` - Static assets

## Blog post frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: 'Post title in sentence case'
description: 'Brief description'
pubDate: 'Jan 07 2026'
heroImage: './image.png'  # Optional, relative path to image in same folder
---
```

## Crossposting workflow

For posts with interactive components (timelines, widgets, etc.), create parallel files:

- `post-name.mdx` - Main blog post with interactive Astro components
- `post-name-crosspost.md` - Text/image version for LinkedIn, Medium, Substack
- `post-name-social.md` - Short posts for X, Bluesky, etc.

The crosspost version replaces interactive components with:
- Text-based timelines (bold dates, descriptions)
- Static images/screenshots of interactive elements
- Links back to the canonical post for the full experience

Example timeline format for crosspost:
```
**Feb 24, 2025** — Anthropic launches Claude Code
The agentic CLI era begins. A simple terminal tool—chat with Claude, edit files, run bash commands.
```

### Publishing to platforms

**Step 1: Copy via Google Docs** (required for images to transfer)
1. Deploy site to maxghenis.com first
2. Go to `maxghenis.com/blog/[post-slug]/crosspost/` (production, not localhost)
3. Click "Copy to clipboard"
4. Paste into a new Google Doc (images upload to Google's servers)
5. Copy the entire Google Doc content (Cmd+A, Cmd+C)

**Step 2: Paste into each platform and add subtitle**

The subtitle from the crosspost page header should be added to each platform:
> "How AI coding tools evolved from autocomplete to autonomous agents, and why I expect to abandon my IDE entirely this month."

| Platform | Subtitle | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Medium** | Type subtitle after title, select it, click **small T** (see below) | Fix numbered lists (Medium mangles them). Delete empty paragraphs after headings. Upload cover image separately. |

| **Substack** | Click "Add a subtitle..." below the title | Upload cover image via Settings. |
| **LinkedIn** | Not supported (subtitle is article-only) | Works well. Upload cover via article settings. |
| **X Articles** | Not supported | Works well. Add cover image if desired. |

**Medium subtitle formatting (CRITICAL):**
1. Type title, press Enter
2. Type subtitle text
3. Triple-click to select subtitle line
4. In the formatting toolbar, there are TWO T icons side by side:
   - **Large T** = Section heading (makes text bigger, bold)
   - **Small T** = Subtitle (makes text gray, smaller) ← USE THIS ONE
5. Click the **small T** (the second/right T icon) to format as subtitle
6. The subtitle will turn gray - this is correct

**What transfers automatically:**
- Text content with formatting (bold, headings, lists)
- Hyperlinks
- Images (via Google Docs intermediary from production URLs)

**What needs manual work:**
- Cover/hero images (upload via each platform's UI)
- Subtitles (copy from crosspost page header, add to Medium/Substack)
- Numbered lists on Medium (known bug - recreate manually)
- Empty paragraphs after headings (delete manually)

**Important:** Must copy from production site, not localhost. Google Docs can't fetch localhost images.
