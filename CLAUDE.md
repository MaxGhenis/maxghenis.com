## Style guide

**CRITICAL: Use sentence case for all headings** - only capitalize the first word and proper nouns.

- ✅ "How it compares to other tools"
- ❌ "How It Compares to Other Tools"

**Colons in titles**: Capitalize the first word after a colon (it's a subtitle).

- ✅ "TerminalGrid: Turn VS Code into a Claude Code superterminal"
- ❌ "TerminalGrid: turn VS Code into a Claude Code superterminal"

**Active voice**: Prefer active voice over passive. Put the actor first.

- ✅ "Anthropic launches Claude Code" / "Google releases Antigravity"
- ❌ "Claude Code was launched" / "Antigravity has been released"
- ✅ "I built this tool" / "The model generates code"
- ❌ "This tool was built" / "Code is generated by the model"

This applies to blog post titles, section headings, page titles, and body text.

**No paywalled sources**: All links should be freely accessible. Use official announcements, free surveys, or archive.is links instead of paywalled articles.
