# maxghenis.com

Personal website built with Astro.

## Style guide

**CRITICAL: Use sentence case for all headings** - only capitalize the first word and proper nouns.

- ✅ "How it compares to other tools"
- ❌ "How It Compares to Other Tools"

**Colons in titles**: Capitalize the first word after a colon (it's a subtitle).

- ✅ "TerminalGrid: Turn VS Code into a Claude Code superterminal"
- ❌ "TerminalGrid: turn VS Code into a Claude Code superterminal"

**Active voice**: Prefer active voice over passive. Put the actor first.

- ✅ "Anthropic launches Claude Code" / "Google releases Antigravity"
- ❌ "Claude Code was launched" / "Antigravity has been released"
- ✅ "I built this tool" / "The model generates code"
- ❌ "This tool was built" / "Code is generated by the model"

This applies to blog post titles, section headings, page titles, and body text.

**No paywalled sources**: All links should be freely accessible. Use official announcements, free surveys, or archive.is links instead of paywalled articles.

## Structure

- `src/content/blog/` - Blog posts (markdown with frontmatter)
- `src/pages/` - Astro pages (projects, cv, rambar, terminalgrid, etc.)
- `src/components/` - Reusable components (Header, Footer, BaseHead)
- `public/` - Static assets

## Blog post frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: 'Post title in sentence case'
description: 'Brief description'
pubDate: 'Jan 07 2026'
heroImage: './image.png'  # Optional, relative path to image in same folder
---
```

## Crossposting workflow

For posts with interactive components (timelines, widgets, etc.), create parallel files:

- `post-name.mdx` - Main blog post with interactive Astro components
- `post-name-crosspost.md` - Text/image version for LinkedIn, Medium, Substack
- `post-name-social.md` - Short posts for X, Bluesky, etc.

The crosspost version replaces interactive components with:
- Text-based timelines (bold dates, descriptions)
- Static images/screenshots of interactive elements
- Links back to the canonical post for the full experience

Example timeline format for crosspost:
```
**Feb 24, 2025** — Anthropic launches Claude Code
The agentic CLI era begins. A simple terminal tool—chat with Claude, edit files, run bash commands.
```

### Publishing to platforms

**Step 1: Copy via Google Docs** (required for images to transfer)
1. Deploy site to maxghenis.com first
2. Go to `maxghenis.com/blog/[post-slug]/crosspost/` (production, not localhost)
3. Click "Copy to clipboard"
4. Paste into a new Google Doc (images upload to Google's servers)
5. Copy the entire Google Doc content (Cmd+A, Cmd+C)

**Step 2: Paste into each platform**

| Platform | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **Medium** | Add subtitle manually. Fix numbered lists (Medium mangles them). Delete empty paragraphs after headings. Upload cover image separately. |
| **Substack** | Add subtitle. Upload cover image via Settings. |
| **LinkedIn** | Works well. Upload cover via article settings. |
| **X Articles** | Works well. Add cover image if desired. |

**What transfers automatically:**
- Text content with formatting (bold, headings, lists)
- Hyperlinks
- Images (via Google Docs intermediary from production URLs)

**What needs manual work:**
- Cover/hero images (upload via each platform's UI)
- Subtitles (not in crosspost content)
- Numbered lists on Medium (known bug - recreate manually)
- Empty paragraphs after headings (delete manually)

**Important:** Must copy from production site, not localhost. Google Docs can't fetch localhost images.
