## From IDE to AI orchestration: The end of code-first development

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/ide-to-ai-orchestration/
**Published:** Jan 11 2026
**Description:** How AI coding tools evolved from autocomplete to autonomous agents, and why I expect to abandon my IDE entirely this month.

import AICodingTimeline from '../../components/AICodingTimeline.astro';
import CrosspostAware from '../../components/CrosspostAware.astro';

Claude Code creator Boris Cherny [recently shared](https://x.com/bcherny/status/2004897269674639461) that since the beginning of December, "100% of my contributions to Claude Code were written by Claude Code." He elaborated: "In the last thirty days, I landed 259 PRs—497 commits, 40k lines added, 38k lines removed. Every single line was written by Claude Code + Opus 4.5."

I've been building entirely in Claude Code since October—longer than Boris because he's a much better developer than I am, so Claude didn't have to be as good. My VS Code is just a shell for Claude Code terminals. It's why I created the [TerminalGrid extension](https://maxghenis.com/terminalgrid)—I haven't used the file editor in months.

The next step in this evolution is to skip the IDE altogether. And 2025's tool launches suggest that's exactly where the industry is heading.

<CrosspostAware>
  <AICodingTimeline slot="interactive" />
  <Fragment slot="static">
## The timeline

**Feb 24, 2025** — [Anthropic launches Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet)
A simple terminal tool—chat with Claude, edit files, run bash commands.

**May 16, 2025** — [OpenAI launches Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/)
A cloud-based software engineering agent that runs tasks in isolated containers.

**Nov 18, 2025** — [Google launches Antigravity](https://developers.googleblog.com/build-with-google-antigravity-our-new-agentic-development-platform/)
An agent-first development platform where you don't touch code—you manage agents.

**Nov 24, 2025** — [Anthropic launches Opus 4.5 + Claude Code in Desktop](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5)
Multiple parallel sessions with isolated git worktrees.

**Jan 6, 2026** — [Anthropic adds local Claude Code to Desktop](https://x.com/_catwu/status/2008628736409956395)
Claude Code can run any shell command, access your filesystem, and control your browser.
  </Fragment>
</CrosspostAware>

The Claude Desktop approach differs from Codex and similar cloud tools in one crucial way: full local access. Claude Code can run any shell command, access your filesystem, and control your browser. Cloud-based agents like Codex run in sandboxed containers with restricted permissions. Claude's bet is that developers want an agent with the same access they have—not a constrained PR-generator.

## The paradigm shift

Google's Antigravity documentation articulates what's happening: the shift from "Editor view" (traditional IDE interface with an agent sidebar) to "Manager view" (orchestrating autonomous agents).

In Manager view, you don't write code—you describe what you want, the agents work in parallel, and you review artifacts (task lists, implementation plans, screenshots, browser recordings). It's project management, not programming.

This matches how I've been working—I typically run 5-10 Claude Code sessions simultaneously through [TerminalGrid](/terminalgrid), spread across a 2x2 grid (sometimes with multiple tabs per cell, sometimes across two VS Code windows):

![TerminalGrid showing multiple Claude Code sessions](./terminalgrid.png)

Boris Cherny [described a similar setup](https://venturebeat.com/technology/the-creator-of-claude-code-just-revealed-his-workflow-and-developers-are): "I run 5 Claudes in parallel in my terminal. I number my tabs 1-5, and use system notifications to know when a Claude needs input." He also runs 5-10 instances on claude.ai, using a "teleport" command to hand off sessions between web and terminal.

## Why I'm not quite there yet

This week I've been experimenting with Claude Code in Desktop, and while it's close to replacing VS Code, I've hit two blocking issues:

1. **No MCP support yet**: Claude Code in the Desktop app doesn't support MCP servers, so I can't use browser automation tools like Claude in Chrome. The same MCPs work fine in VS Code's terminal and in non-Code Claude Desktop. I [posted about this](https://x.com/MaxGhenis/status/2009808936212549910)—a Claude Code engineer [replied](https://x.com/amorriscode/status/2010410355030421700) that MCP support should come next week.

2. **Sessions drop when switching accounts**: I run out of quota on my Claude Max 20x account regularly (those 5 parallel Claude instances add up), so I maintain two accounts. Claude Desktop drops sessions when I switch between them, losing context.

## The bigger picture

[As of late 2025](https://blog.jetbrains.com/research/2025/10/state-of-developer-ecosystem-2025/), roughly 85% of developers regularly use AI tools for coding. [Stack Overflow's 2025 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/) found 65% use them weekly. The question isn't whether AI will change how we code—it's whether we'll still call what we do "coding" at all.

Boris Cherny's workflow hints at the answer. He doesn't code. He orchestrates agents. He described using Opus 4.5 for everything because "even though it's bigger & slower than Sonnet, since you have to steer it less and it's better at tool use, it is almost always faster than using a smaller model in the end."

That's the trade-off: more capable models need less human steering, which means less time in the editor, which means the editor matters less.

## What happens next

I expect Anthropic to fix both blocking issues this month. When they do, I'll switch from VS Code to Claude Desktop, and TerminalGrid will join the graveyard of tools I've built that AI capabilities have rendered obsolete.

[CodeStitch](https://codestitch.dev), which I built in mid-2024 to paste codebases into Claude's context window, was obsolete within months of Claude Code maturing. TerminalGrid solved a real problem for exactly the window between "Claude Code exists" and "Claude Code has a native manager interface." That window is closing.

The pattern for developer tooling: ship fast, solve the problem in front of you, expect obsolescence. Frontier labs are moving so quickly on general-purpose dev tools that anything built to improve them has a short shelf life.

But that's fine. Disposable tools can accelerate progress toward bigger challenges. The real opportunity isn't building better coding tools—it's applying AI to problems that matter. Health, poverty, governance, the environment. If you can ship in days what used to take months, you can tackle problems that were previously out of reach.

When Claude Desktop works reliably, I'll abandon my TerminalGridded IDE without looking back—and get back to the real work.

## Domain Migrator: Automating bulk domain transfers to Cloudflare

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/domain-migrator/
**Published:** Jan 11 2026
**Description:** A Chrome extension that automates the tedious process of transferring multiple domains from GoDaddy or Squarespace to Cloudflare.

## Why Cloudflare?

I'm consolidating all my domains to Cloudflare for several reasons:

- **At-cost pricing** - Cloudflare charges wholesale prices with no markup. Domain renewals are typically $2-5 cheaper per year than GoDaddy or Squarespace.
- **Free DNS** - Fast, reliable DNS with DDoS protection included
- **Free SSL** - Automatic HTTPS for all domains
- **Email routing** - Free email forwarding without needing a separate service
- **No upsells** - Clean interface without constant attempts to sell you add-ons
- **API access** - Programmatic control over DNS and other settings

Currently Domain Migrator only supports Cloudflare as the destination, but I could add other registrars (GoDaddy, Squarespace, Namecheap, Porkbun, etc.) in the future if there's demand.

## The tedium of domain transfers

Transferring domains between registrars is one of the most tedious tasks in web administration. Each domain requires:

1. Unlocking the domain at the source registrar
2. Getting an authorization (EPP) code
3. Adding the domain to the new registrar
4. Selecting a plan
5. Copying the new nameservers
6. Updating nameservers at the source registrar
7. Waiting for propagation

Multiply this by 8 domains and you're looking at hours of clicking through slow web interfaces.

I built **Domain Migrator** to automate this entire workflow.

## The problem with existing tools

I researched existing options before building this:

**Registrar bulk transfer tools** - [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/domains/bulk-domain-transfer), [Dynadot](https://www.dynadot.com/domain/bulk-transfer), and others offer bulk transfer *into* their platform. But they still require you to manually:
- Unlock each domain at your current registrar
- Copy auth codes one by one
- Paste them into the bulk transfer form

**Cloudflare API scripts** - [Centmin Mod's blog](https://blog.centminmod.com/2021/03/04/2333/how-to-bulk-domain-transfer-to-cloudflare-registrar-and-save-on-domain-renewal-costs/) shows bash scripts for bulk transfers using Cloudflare's API. But these still require manually gathering auth codes first. And the [Cloudflare API doesn't support API tokens](https://blog.centminmod.com/2021/02/28/2310/how-to-bulk-domain-transfer-out-from-cloudflare-registrar-via-cloudflare-api/) for registrar operations—you need your global API key.

**No end-to-end solution** - I couldn't find any tool that automates the *entire* workflow from source registrar to destination. The bottleneck is always "get your auth codes manually first."

## How Domain Migrator works

Domain Migrator is a Chrome extension that:

1. **Scans your registrar** - Navigate to GoDaddy or Squarespace, click import, and it finds all your domains
2. **Gets auth codes automatically** - Navigates to each domain's transfer page and extracts the authorization code
3. **Adds to Cloudflare** - Opens Cloudflare, adds the domain, selects the free plan
4. **Copies nameservers** - Extracts the assigned Cloudflare nameservers
5. **Updates the source** - Goes back to GoDaddy/Squarespace and updates the nameservers

All while showing progress in a status bar:

```
✓ Get auth code → ✓ Add to Cloudflare → ✓ Select plan → ● Get nameservers → ○ Update nameservers → ○ Done
```

## Technical challenges

Building this taught me a lot about browser automation in 2026:

**SPA navigation** - Both GoDaddy and Cloudflare are single-page apps. The URL changes but the page doesn't fully reload. I had to use MutationObserver to detect navigation and reinitialize the content scripts.

**React input handling** - GoDaddy uses React, which has its own synthetic event system. Simply setting `input.value` doesn't trigger React's state updates. I had to use the native HTMLInputElement value setter and dispatch multiple event types.

**2FA interruptions** - GoDaddy sometimes prompts for 2FA mid-flow. The extension detects this, pauses, and waits for the user to complete verification before resuming.

**Error recovery** - Domains can have "pending events" that block nameserver changes. The extension detects these states and handles them gracefully.

## Completion verification

Each domain tracks three pieces of data:
- `authCode` - The EPP authorization code
- `cloudflareAdded` - Whether it's been added to Cloudflare
- `nameservers.cloudflare` - The assigned Cloudflare nameservers

A domain is only marked complete when all three exist AND the nameserver update succeeds at the source registrar.

## Try it

The extension is open source: [github.com/maxghenis/domain-migrator](https://github.com/maxghenis/domain-migrator)

To install:
1. Clone the repo
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the repo folder

Then navigate to your GoDaddy or Squarespace domain portfolio and click the extension icon to start.

## What's next

- **More registrars** - Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.
- **Cloudflare API integration** - Use the API where possible instead of browser automation
- **Better error handling** - More graceful recovery from edge cases
- **Firefox support** - Port to Firefox extension APIs

## TerminalGrid: Turn VS Code into a Claude Code superterminal

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/terminalgrid/
**Published:** Jan 07 2026
**Description:** A VS Code extension for keyboard-driven terminal grid management with project picker and auto-launch for AI coding tools.

I run multiple Claude Code sessions simultaneously—one for each project I'm working on. VS Code's terminal panel only splits in one direction—no 2D grids. And the native terminal has [issues with image pasting](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1361) that matter when you're sharing screenshots with Claude.

So I built [TerminalGrid](https://maxghenis.com/terminalgrid)—my first VS Code extension, built 100% with Claude Code.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <iframe
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border-radius: 12px;"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I3neOEJzi6M"
    title="TerminalGrid Demo"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

## VS Code as a shell for coding agents

Boris Cherny, who created Claude Code, [recently shared](https://x.com/bcherny/status/2004897269674639461) that 100% of his contributions to Claude Code in the past month were written by Claude Code itself. I've been operating this way for two to three months now—not writing any code myself. Of course, Boris is a much better programmer than I am, so I had less to discard.

This shift has changed how I use VS Code. I've stopped looking at the code directly; VS Code is now just a shell for coding agents. I don't use the file explorer or most other features. It's still better than a raw terminal since it lets you paste screenshots, but otherwise I just keep it as a grid of Claude Code sessions.

## The problem

VS Code's [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics) only splits in one direction at a time—side-by-side when the panel is at the bottom, or stacked when it's on the side. No 2D grids. This has been requested since 2018 ([#56112](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/56112), [#160501](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/160501)) and people are still asking in 2025 ([#254638](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/254638), [#252458](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/252458)).

Other extensions like [Split Terminal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BrianNicholls.split-terminal) and [Workspace Layout](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lostintangent.workspace-layout) don't solve this—they work within the terminal panel's limitations.

When you're running 4+ AI coding sessions, you need a proper grid:

```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│  policyengine   │  api-server     │
│  (Claude Code)  │  (Claude Code)  │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│  docs           │  frontend       │
│  (Claude Code)  │  (Claude Code)  │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

## The solution

TerminalGrid moves terminals to the editor area, where VS Code already supports full grid layouts. Then it adds keyboard shortcuts and a project picker:

1. **`Cmd+K Cmd+N`** — Opens a searchable list of your projects
2. **Pick a project** — Type to filter, select with Enter
3. **Terminal launches** — Runs `cd <project> && claude` automatically

The terminal is named after the folder, so you always know which Claude is working on what.

## Setup

```json
{
  "terminalgrid.projectDirectories": ["~/projects", "~/code"],
  "terminalgrid.autoLaunchCommand": "claude"
}
```

That's it. Now every `Cmd+K Cmd+Down/Right/N` gives you a project picker that launches Claude in the right directory.

## Other features

- **Crash recovery** — Terminal directories persist even if VS Code crashes
- **Image pasting** — Editor-area terminals handle screenshots better than the terminal panel
- **Works with any CLI tool** — Aider, Codex, Gemini CLI, or just plain shells

## Get it

Install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MaxGhenis.terminalgrid) or:

```bash
code --install-extension MaxGhenis.terminalgrid
```

## RAMBar: A macOS menu bar RAM monitor for developers

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/rambar/
**Published:** Jan 07 2026
**Description:** A native macOS menu bar app for tracking memory usage across Claude Code sessions, VS Code workspaces, Chrome tabs, and Python processes.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <iframe
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border-radius: 12px;"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6lnQpfxJs0Y"
    title="RAMBar Demo"

    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"

  </iframe>
</div>

Claude Opus 4.5 kept crashing my VS Code.

Nothing wrong with the model—it was just so good that I started running 5, 6, even a dozen Claude Code sessions at once. My 16GB MacBook Air couldn't keep up. I upgraded to a 48GB MacBook Pro, which mostly solved the crashes, but I still had no visibility into what was eating memory. Activity Monitor shows processes, but not answers like "which Claude session is the hog?" or "can I spawn another subagent?"

So I built [RAMBar](https://maxghenis.com/rambar)—my first macOS app, built entirely with Claude Code. It shows RAM usage the way developers think about it.

## What It Does

RAMBar lives in your menu bar showing current RAM percentage, color-coded by status:

- **Green**: Under 70%, you're fine
- **Yellow**: 70-85%, getting tight
- **Red**: Over 85%, time to close something

Click it to see a breakdown of what's actually using your memory.

## Developer-Focused Breakdowns

Unlike generic system monitors, RAMBar understands developer workflows:

- **Claude Code sessions** — Shows main sessions vs subagents separately, so you can see when parallel agents are spawning
- **VS Code workspaces** — Memory grouped by which project folder is open
- **Chrome tabs** — Lists individual tabs by memory, so you can find that one tab eating 2GB
- **Python processes** — Useful when you're running Jupyter notebooks or ML training alongside everything else

## How it compares to other tools

Several macOS menu bar monitors exist, but none understand developer workflows:

| Tool | Price | Developer context | Claude Code awareness |
|------|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **RAMBar** | Free | ✅ Groups by workspace/session | ✅ Shows sessions + subagents |
| [Stats](https://github.com/exelban/stats) | Free | ❌ Process-level only | ❌ |
| [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) | $12 | ❌ Process-level only | ❌ |
| [MenuBar Stats](https://seense.com/menubarstats/) | $5 | ❌ Process-level only | ❌ |
| Activity Monitor | Free | ❌ Process-level only | ❌ |

[Stats](https://github.com/exelban/stats) is excellent for general system monitoring—CPU graphs, network throughput, disk I/O—and it's free and open source. [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) adds weather widgets, fan control, and extensive customization for $12.

RAMBar solves a different problem. When I see high memory usage, I don't want to know that `node` is using 4GB—I want to know *which VS Code workspace* that node process belongs to. I don't care that there are 47 Chrome Helper processes; I want to know which *tab* is the culprit. And when Claude Code spawns subagents, I want to see that hierarchy, not a flat list of identical `claude` processes.

If you need comprehensive system monitoring, use Stats or iStat Menus. If you're an AI-assisted developer who wants to know why your Mac is struggling during a coding session, RAMBar fills that gap.

## Get it

```bash
brew tap maxghenis/tap
brew install --cask rambar
```

Or download from [maxghenis.com/rambar](https://maxghenis.com/rambar). Source on [GitHub](https://github.com/MaxGhenis/rambar).

Requires macOS 14.0+. First launch: right-click and select Open to bypass Gatekeeper (the app is currently unsigned).

## The definitive QALY analysis of nuts

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/_which-nut-is-healthiest-bayesian-qaly-analysis/
**Published:** Dec 19 2025
**Description:** A rigorous, evidence-based Monte Carlo simulation estimating the lifetime health impact of different nut types. The most comprehensive quantitative nut health analysis available.

This is an attempt to answer, rigorously, a question that AI assistants typically refuse: **How many quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) do you gain from eating different types of nuts?**

QALYs are the gold standard in health economics—one QALY equals one year of perfect health. By expressing nut benefits in QALYs, we can compare them to exercise, medications, and other interventions on the same scale.

## Why This Analysis Exists

I've been adopting much of Bryan Johnson's [Blueprint protocol](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/), including his signature [Nutty Pudding](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/nutty-pudding-protein-mix)—a macadamia-heavy concoction that Johnson describes as his favorite meal of the day. The recipe includes 3 tablespoons of ground macadamia nuts, macadamia nut milk, plus walnuts and other ingredients.

This got me wondering: is Johnson's emphasis on macadamias justified? How do they actually compare to other nuts in terms of lifetime health impact?

I asked two AI assistants to estimate the QALY effect of different nut types. Google's Gemini [refused entirely](https://gemini.google.com/app/123b3b50a353679f): "I can't provide a single point estimate for QALYs related to switching nuts." Claude engaged, made mistakes, corrected them when I pointed out pseudo-frequentist reasoning, and eventually produced useful Bayesian estimates.

This post takes that methodology further: systematic literature review, explicit parameter estimation, Monte Carlo simulation, and sensitivity analysis. The goal is a quantitative framework others can critique, replicate, and improve.

## The Evidence Base

### Nuts and All-Cause Mortality

The strongest evidence for nut health comes from large meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies.

**Aune et al. (2016), BMC Medicine** - 29 prospective studies, 819,448 participants:
- 28g/day nut consumption: **RR 0.78 (95% CI: 0.72-0.84)** for all-cause mortality
- Dose-response: benefits plateau around 15-20g/day
- No significant heterogeneity across studies (I² = 36%)

**Grosso et al. (2015), American Journal of Clinical Nutrition** - 18 studies, 636,104 participants:
- Highest vs. lowest nut consumption: **RR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.77-0.85)** for all-cause mortality
- **RR 0.73 (95% CI: 0.67-0.80)** for cardiovascular mortality
- **RR 0.85 (95% CI: 0.79-0.91)** for cancer mortality

**Bao et al. (2013), New England Journal of Medicine** - NHS and HPFS cohorts, 118,962 participants:
- 7+ servings/week vs. never: **HR 0.80 (95% CI: 0.73-0.86)** for all-cause mortality
- Association persisted after adjustment for BMI, smoking, diet quality

### Converting Relative Risk to Life Expectancy

For a 40-year-old US adult with ~40 years remaining life expectancy:

```
# Baseline annual mortality rate at age 40: ~0.2%
# Remaining life expectancy: ~40 years

# With 22% mortality reduction (RR 0.78):
# Simplified: life_gain ≈ remaining_years * (1 - RR) / RR
# = 40 * (1 - 0.78) / 0.78 = 11.3 years

# But this overestimates because mortality rates increase with age
# More realistic integrated calculation: ~3-4 years of life gained
```

Using actuarial life tables with age-varying mortality, a sustained 22% mortality reduction from age 40 yields approximately **3.2 years of additional life expectancy** (95% CI: 2.1-4.5 years).

### Nut-Specific Evidence

Here's where evidence becomes thinner. Most mortality studies report "nuts" as a category.

**Walnuts** have the strongest nut-specific evidence:
- WAHA Trial (Ros et al., 2021): 30-60g/day walnuts for 2 years reduced LDL by 4.3 mg/dL, improved endothelial function
- PREDIMED subanalysis: walnuts associated with HR 0.55 (95% CI: 0.34-0.88) for cardiovascular death
- Unique among nuts in providing ALA omega-3 (2.5g per oz)

**Almonds** have extensive RCT data on biomarkers:
- Meta-analysis (Musa-Veloso et al., 2016): 45g/day reduces LDL by 5.3 mg/dL
- Highest vitamin E content (7.3mg/oz, 49% DV)
- No hard outcome trials

**Pistachios** show strongest lipid effects:
- Network meta-analysis (Del Gobbo et al., 2015): ranked first for LDL and triglyceride reduction
- Strongest ox-LDL reduction among nuts

**Macadamias** have limited direct evidence:
- Small RCTs show comparable LDL reduction to other nuts
- FDA qualified health claim based on totality of evidence
- Unique omega-7 (palmitoleic acid) content—theoretical mechanism for metabolic benefit
- Highest MUFA content (80% of fat)

**Peanuts** (technically legumes) show similar effects:
- Large cohort data shows mortality benefit comparable to tree nuts
- Shanghai Women's Health Study: HR 0.83 for all-cause mortality

## Parameter Estimation

For Monte Carlo simulation, each uncertain quantity needs a probability distribution.

### Core Parameters

**Hazard ratio for all-cause mortality (nuts vs. no nuts):**
```
HR ~ LogNormal(μ = ln(0.78), σ = 0.08)
# Median: 0.78
# 95% CI: 0.67-0.91
# Based on Aune et al. meta-analysis
```

**Remaining life expectancy (40-year-old, US):**
```
LE ~ Normal(μ = 40, σ = 3)
# Accounts for individual variation and uncertainty in projections
```

**Quality weight (average health utility):**
```
Q ~ Beta(α = 17, β = 3)
# Mean: 0.85
# Slight left skew (some people have chronic conditions)
# Based on population EQ-5D norms
```

**Years of life gained from mortality reduction:**
```
# Integrated over age-specific mortality
YLG ~ Normal(μ = 3.2, σ = 0.8)
# Derived from actuarial calculation with uncertainty
```

### Nut-Specific Adjustments

For each nut, we model a multiplicative adjustment to the base effect:

| Nut | Adjustment Factor | Distribution | Rationale |
|-----|-------------------|--------------|-----------|
| Walnut | 1.15 (σ=0.08) | Normal | Strong direct evidence, omega-3 |
| Pistachio | 1.08 (σ=0.12) | Normal | Best lipid biomarkers |
| Almond | 1.00 (σ=0.06) | Normal | Reference category, robust RCTs |
| Macadamia | 1.02 (σ=0.15) | Normal | Prior-dominated, omega-7 optionality |
| Peanut | 0.95 (σ=0.07) | Normal | Omega-6 concern, large cohort data |
| Pecan | 0.98 (σ=0.18) | Normal | Very limited data, prior-dominated |
| Cashew | 0.92 (σ=0.14) | Normal | Limited data, weaker nutrient profile |

The key insight: **sparse evidence increases σ (uncertainty), not the mean**. Macadamia's mean (1.02) is near the reference; its σ (0.15) is high because we're uncertain.

### Mechanism-Level Effects

Nuts affect health through specific biological pathways. For validation, we model effects at the mechanism level and check they're consistent with aggregate mortality.

**Cardiovascular mechanisms:**
```
LDL_reduction ~ Normal(μ = -8%, σ = 4%)
# mg/dL: ~-6 (from -15g/dL at 45g/day scaled)

BP_reduction ~ Normal(μ = -2 mmHg, σ = 1.5)
# Smaller effect than dedicated interventions

Inflammation_reduction ~ Normal(μ = -15%, σ = 8%)
# CRP reduction from meta-analyses
```

**Metabolic mechanisms:**
```
Insulin_sensitivity ~ Normal(μ = +12%, σ = 6%)
# HOMA-IR improvement from RCTs

HbA1c ~ Normal(μ = -0.1%, σ = 0.08%)
# Small effect in non-diabetics
```

**Mechanism→Mortality mapping (from Mendelian randomization):**
- 10 mmHg SBP reduction: HR 0.87 for stroke, 0.83 for CHD
- 1 mmol/L LDL reduction: HR 0.78 for cardiovascular events
- Inflammation: weak causal evidence, conservative estimate

Integrating mechanism-level effects yields HR ~0.82-0.85, consistent with the observed HR ~0.78 (the residual may be from unmeasured mechanisms or healthy-user confounding).

## Monte Carlo Simulation

### Algorithm

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

def simulate_nut_qalys(nut_type, n_simulations=10000, age=40):
    """
    Monte Carlo simulation of lifetime QALY gain from daily nut consumption.
    """
    # Base parameters (nuts vs no nuts)
    base_hr = stats.lognorm(s=0.08, scale=0.78).rvs(n_simulations)
    remaining_le = stats.norm(40, 3).rvs(n_simulations)
    quality_weight = stats.beta(17, 3).rvs(n_simulations)

    # Nut-specific adjustment factors
    adjustments = {

    # Adjusted hazard ratio
    # Higher adjustment = lower HR = better survival
    adj_hr = base_hr ** adj_factor

    # Years of life gained (simplified model)
    # More accurate: integrate over age-specific mortality
    ylg_base = stats.norm(3.2, 0.8).rvs(n_simulations)
    ylg = ylg_base * (np.log(0.78) / np.log(adj_hr))

    # Quality-of-life effect (small, independent of mortality)

    quality_qalys = remaining_le * qol_effect * quality_weight
    total_qalys = mortality_qalys + quality_qalys

    return total_qalys, mortality_qalys, quality_qalys

# Run for each nut type
results = {}
for nut in ['walnut', 'pistachio', 'almond', 'macadamia', 'peanut', 'pecan', 'cashew']:
    total, mort, qual = simulate_nut_qalys(nut)
    results[nut] = {
        'median': np.median(total),
        'mean': np.mean(total),
        'ci80': (np.percentile(total, 10), np.percentile(total, 90)),

```

### Results

| Nut | Median | Mean | 80% CI | 95% CI | P(>0) | P(>1yr) |
|-----|--------|------|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Walnut** | +2.94 | +2.98 | [+2.01, +4.02] | [+1.42, +4.72] | 99.9% | 98.2% |
| **Pistachio** | +2.61 | +2.68 | [+1.58, +3.82] | [+0.88, +4.62] | 99.2% | 94.6% |
| **Almond** | +2.54 | +2.56 | [+1.78, +3.38] | [+1.21, +4.02] | 99.8% | 97.1% |
| **Macadamia** | +2.58 | +2.65 | [+1.38, +3.98] | [+0.58, +4.92] | 97.8% | 89.4% |
| **Peanut** | +2.38 | +2.41 | [+1.62, +3.22] | [+1.05, +3.88] | 99.6% | 95.8% |
| **Pecan** | +2.48 | +2.55 | [+1.12, +4.02] | [+0.28, +5.02] | 96.2% | 86.1% |
| **Cashew** | +2.28 | +2.35 | [+1.08, +3.68] | [+0.32, +4.58] | 96.8% | 84.2% |

### Decomposition by Mechanism

| Nut | Mortality | Quality of Life | Uncertainty (σ) |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Walnut | +2.26 (77%) | +0.68 (23%) | 0.78 |
| Pistachio | +2.01 (77%) | +0.60 (23%) | 0.92 |
| Almond | +1.96 (77%) | +0.58 (23%) | 0.62 |
| Macadamia | +1.99 (77%) | +0.59 (23%) | 1.15 |
| Peanut | +1.84 (77%) | +0.54 (23%) | 0.68 |
| Pecan | +1.91 (77%) | +0.57 (23%) | 1.28 |
| Cashew | +1.76 (77%) | +0.52 (23%) | 1.08 |

About 77% of the QALY benefit comes from mortality reduction; 23% from quality of life improvements (cardiovascular symptoms, metabolic health, cognitive function).

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Parameter Impact on Walnut Estimate

| Parameter | Baseline | Range Tested | Impact on Median |
|-----------|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Base HR | 0.78 | 0.72-0.84 | ±0.52 QALYs |
| HR uncertainty (σ) | 0.08 | 0.05-0.12 | ±0.15 on CI width |
| Life expectancy | 40 yr | 30-50 yr | ±0.74 QALYs |
| Quality weight | 0.85 | 0.75-0.92 | ±0.38 QALYs |
| Nut adjustment | 1.15 | 1.05-1.25 | ±0.41 QALYs |

**Key finding**: The single largest driver of uncertainty is the base mortality hazard ratio, not nut-specific evidence. Even perfect nut-specific data would only tighten CIs by ~15%.

### Age Sensitivity

QALY gains depend strongly on age at intervention start:

| Starting Age | Remaining LE | Walnut QALYs | Macadamia QALYs |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 25 | 55 years | +4.05 | +3.55 |
| 40 | 40 years | +2.94 | +2.58 |
| 55 | 27 years | +1.99 | +1.75 |
| 70 | 15 years | +1.10 | +0.97 |

Younger people have more years to benefit, so the QALY impact scales roughly linearly with remaining life expectancy.

### Dose-Response

The mortality meta-analyses suggest benefits plateau around 15-20g/day:

| Daily Intake | Relative Benefit | Walnut QALYs |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| 7g (0.25 oz) | 60% | +1.76 |
| 15g (0.5 oz) | 90% | +2.65 |
| 28g (1 oz) | 100% | +2.94 |
| 56g (2 oz) | 102% | +3.00 |

The marginal benefit of going from 1 oz to 2 oz is minimal.

## The Confounding Problem

A critical limitation: **all mortality evidence is observational**. People who eat nuts regularly may differ systematically from those who don't.

The Bao et al. (2013) NEJM study found that nut consumers:
- Were more physically active
- Less likely to smoke
- Had higher education
- Consumed more fruits and vegetables

After adjustment for these factors, the association persisted (HR 0.80), but residual confounding is possible.

**Mendelian randomization** partially addresses this. Studies using genetic instruments for LDL cholesterol show that nut-induced LDL reduction should translate to cardiovascular benefit. But no MR study directly instruments nut consumption.

**Adjustment factor for confounding uncertainty:**
```
confounding_adjustment ~ Beta(α = 8, β = 2)
# Mean: 0.80 (assumes ~20% of observed effect is confounding)
# 95% CI: 0.55-0.95
```

Incorporating this adjustment:

| Nut | Raw Median | Confounding-Adjusted Median | Adjusted 95% CI |
|-----|------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| Walnut | +2.94 | +2.35 | [+0.78, +4.12] |
| Macadamia | +2.58 | +2.06 | [+0.31, +4.28] |
| Almond | +2.54 | +2.03 | [+0.70, +3.58] |

## Cost-Effectiveness

At ~$15/lb for walnuts (~16 oz of nuts), annual cost is ~$340 for 1 oz/day.

| Nut | Annual Cost | Lifetime Cost (40yr) | QALYs | Cost/QALY |
|-----|-------------|---------------------|-------|-----------|
| Walnut | $340 | $13,600 | +2.35 | $5,787 |
| Peanut | $80 | $3,200 | +1.90 | $1,684 |
| Almond | $280 | $11,200 | +2.03 | $5,517 |
| Macadamia | $520 | $20,800 | +2.06 | $10,097 |

For reference, health interventions below $50,000/QALY are typically considered cost-effective. **All nuts are highly cost-effective by this standard.**

Peanuts are the most cost-effective at ~$1,700/QALY—comparable to generic statins ($2,000-5,000/QALY).

## Comparison to Other Interventions

How do nuts compare to other lifestyle interventions?

| Intervention | QALY Estimate | Evidence Quality | Cost/QALY |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| **30 min walking/day** | +3.2 [+2.1, +4.5] | High (RCTs + cohorts) | ~$0 |
| **Quit smoking** | +5.8 [+4.2, +7.8] | High (overwhelming data) | ~$0 |
| **Daily nut consumption** | +2.5 [+1.0, +4.2] | Moderate (observational) | ~$4,000 |
| **Mediterranean diet** | +2.8 [+1.8, +4.0] | High (PREDIMED RCT) | ~$2,000 |
| **Statin (primary prevention)** | +0.8 [+0.4, +1.4] | High (RCTs) | ~$3,000 |
| **7-8 hours sleep** | +1.5 [+0.8, +2.4] | Moderate (observational) | ~$0 |

Nuts rank in the middle tier of lifestyle interventions—meaningful benefit, moderate certainty. The effect size is similar to Mediterranean diet (which typically includes nuts).

## The Omega-7 Question: Bryan Johnson's Macadamia Bet

Bryan Johnson's Blueprint protocol emphasizes macadamias heavily. In a January 2025 [post on X](https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1877114242379427944), he wrote:

> "Why I consume extra virgin olive oil and macadamia nuts: they function as natural Ozempic. Mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are abundant in extra virgin olive oil, macadamia nuts, and avocados. High intake of mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) is associated with a 6% reduction in all cause mortality risk. Replacing saturated fats (5% of total calorie intake) with MUFAs was associated with a 15%, 10%, and 11% decrease in all-cause, heart disease, and cancer mortality risk."

His [Nutty Pudding recipe](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/Step-1-Step-2-Step-3) (which Johnson says is "the saddest moment of his day" when he takes the last bite) includes:
- 50-100 mL macadamia nut milk
- 3 Tbsp ground macadamia nuts
- 2 tsp ground walnuts
- Plus chia seeds, flaxseed, berries, and other ingredients

Blueprint's [macadamia products](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/raw-macadamias) emphasize that macadamias are "a unique source of rare Omega 7s, which support natural collagen production and metabolic health."

**The omega-7 hypothesis:**
- Palmitoleic acid may improve insulin sensitivity independently of other MUFAs
- Some evidence for anti-inflammatory effects
- Theorized to support collagen production and skin health
- Macadamias contain ~20% palmitoleic acid (unique among common nuts)
- Macadamia oil is ~60% oleic acid (omega-9) + ~20% palmitoleic acid (omega-7)

**Evidence quality: Low**
- Few human RCTs specifically on omega-7
- Most studies use sea buckthorn oil, not macadamias
- Confounded by palmitic acid content (potentially harmful)
- The [Journal of Nutritional Science review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10173088/) notes macadamia evidence is "supportive but not conclusive"

**Modeling the optionality:**
```python
# Probability omega-7 has meaningful independent benefit
p_benefit = stats.beta(2, 6).rvs(n_simulations)  # Mean ~0.25

# Conditional QALY gain if omega-7 hypothesis is true
conditional_gain = stats.norm(0.5, 0.2).rvs(n_simulations)

# Expected value
omega7_contribution = p_benefit * conditional_gain
# Median: ~0.12 QALYs
```

This contributes ~0.12 QALYs to macadamia's estimate—small but non-zero. Johnson is essentially betting on the right tail of macadamia's wide confidence interval. Given that macadamia's point estimate is competitive with almonds, this isn't unreasonable—especially if you, like Johnson, genuinely enjoy eating them.

## The Within-Category vs. Between-Category Effect

**Critical finding**: The spread between nuts (~0.7 QALYs from walnut to cashew) is small compared to the nuts-vs-no-nuts effect (~2.5 QALYs).

```
Effect of eating any nut daily:           +2.5 QALYs [+1.0, +4.2]
Effect of choosing walnut over cashew:    +0.7 QALYs [-0.8, +2.1]
```

The second confidence interval includes zero. We cannot confidently say walnuts beat cashews at the individual level—the uncertainty bands overlap substantially.

**Implication**: The first-order decision (eat nuts) matters far more than the second-order decision (which nut).

## The Compliance Factor

One variable not captured in the simulation: **sustained adherence over decades**.

If you hate walnuts but love macadamias:

```python
# Probability of maintaining daily consumption for 40 years
p_compliance_walnut = 0.4   # Don't enjoy them
p_compliance_macadamia = 0.9  # Love them

# Compliance-adjusted expected QALY
E_walnut = 2.94 * 0.4 = 1.18
E_macadamia = 2.58 * 0.9 = 2.32
```

The "inferior" nut delivers nearly 2x the expected benefit when compliance is factored in.

## Limitations

1. **Observational mortality data**: No RCTs with mortality endpoints exist for nuts. Residual confounding is possible.

2. **Heterogeneity**: Individual responses to nuts vary. The population-average effect may not apply to you.

3. **Nut-specific evidence is thin**: Most mortality data is for "nuts" as a category. Nut-specific rankings are driven largely by priors.

4. **Dose uncertainty**: Optimal intake is unclear. We assume 1 oz/day based on meta-analysis peaks.

5. **No long-term RCTs**: The longest nut RCTs are 2-3 years with biomarker endpoints.

6. **Publication bias**: Positive results more likely to be published.

7. **Model specification**: Different modeling choices could shift estimates by 20-30%.

## Practical Recommendations

Based on 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations with explicit uncertainty quantification:

**1. Eat nuts daily.** The category-level effect (~2.5 QALYs) is large and relatively robust across studies.

**2. If optimizing: slight edge to walnuts.** Strongest evidence base (WAHA trial, PREDIMED subanalysis), unique omega-3 content, hard outcome data.

**3. Macadamias are fine.** Point estimate (+2.58 QALYs) is competitive with almonds (+2.54). Wide CI reflects uncertainty, not inferior expected value. The omega-7 optionality adds small upside.

**4. Peanuts are cost-effective.** At ~$1,700/QALY, peanuts deliver excellent value. The slightly lower point estimate (+2.38) is offset by lower cost.

**5. Don't overthink it.** The 95% CIs for all nuts overlap. Preference and compliance matter more than marginal optimization.

**6. 0.5-1 oz/day is sufficient.** Benefits plateau; doubling intake doesn't double benefit.

## Conclusion

The definitive answer to "which nut is healthiest?" is: **probably walnuts, but it barely matters—eat whichever nuts you'll actually consume consistently.**

The expected difference between the "best" and "worst" common nut is ~0.7 QALYs over a lifetime—about 8 months of perfect health across 40+ years. That's meaningful, but:

- The uncertainty range is ±1.5 QALYs
- The nuts-vs-no-nuts effect is 3-4x larger
- Compliance effects can easily dominate

If you love macadamias and hate walnuts, eat macadamias. You'll capture >95% of the potential benefit and actually stick with it.

The methodology here—Bayesian priors, mechanism-based decomposition, Monte Carlo simulation, explicit uncertainty quantification—applies far beyond nuts. It's how we should reason about any health intervention: exercise protocols, sleep optimization, dietary patterns, supplements.

Quantify the uncertainty. Propagate it honestly. Make decisions based on distributions, not false precision.

## How to Use MDX for Interactive Posts

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/using-mdx/
**Published:** Nov 25 2025
**Description:** This blog supports MDX, allowing you to embed React components, Plotly charts, and interactive elements directly in posts.

This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and supports MDX, which lets you embed interactive components directly in your markdown posts.

## What You Can Do

With MDX, posts can include:

- **React components** with full interactivity
- **Plotly charts** for data visualization
- **Custom calculators** or interactive widgets
- **Embedded iframes** for external apps

## Example: Interactive Button

Here's a simple interactive component embedded in this post:

import HeaderLink from '../../components/HeaderLink.astro';

<HeaderLink href="#" onclick="alert('MDX works!')">
	Click me - I'm interactive!
</HeaderLink>

## Adding Plotly Charts

For data-heavy posts, you can create a React component with Plotly and embed it:

```jsx
// src/components/MyChart.tsx
import Plot from 'react-plotly.js';

export default function MyChart() {
  return (
    <Plot
      data={[{ x: [1, 2, 3], y: [2, 6, 3], type: 'scatter' }]}
      layout={{ title: 'My Chart' }}
    />
  );
}
```

Then in your MDX post:

```mdx
import MyChart from '../../components/MyChart';

<MyChart client:load />

## VAT thresholds, revenues, and the role of counterfactuals

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/substack/vat-thresholds/
**Published:** Aug 30 2025
**Description:** Debunking claims that raising the UK VAT threshold would increase tax revenues through growth effects.

The Telegraph [reported today](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/30/reeves-talks-to-raise-vat-threshold-battle-to-grow-economy/) that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is considering raising the VAT registration threshold—the turnover above which businesses must register for VAT. The Telegraph's source reported that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) determined that raising the threshold would eventually increase tax revenues.

Readers might interpret this as evidence the VAT sits on the right side of the [Laffer curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve)—where tax cuts generate enough growth to pay for themselves. Four major AI models—[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/68b305a8-5b7c-8001-a4c9-ec19432abe31), [Claude](https://claude.ai/share/1ade8513-c6b1-4548-af40-44cf25f166b9), [Gemini](https://g.co/gemini/share/2b375e7d35fc), and [Grok](https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5LWNvcHk%3D_be2046d9-8b0f-4fd3-ad97-b729c70ee0c1)—reached this conclusion when I tested them, attributing long-run gains to reduced [bunching](https://obr.uk/box/the-impact-of-the-frozen-vat-registration-threshold/) and stronger business growth.

The actual explanation is simpler. The revenue increase in 2028-29 occurs because the policy threshold (£90,000) will be lower than the inflation-indexed baseline threshold by that point.

## What the government projected

While the Telegraph did not link an OBR reference, the sources were likely referring to HMRC's [policy paper](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-increasing-the-registration-and-deregistration-thresholds/increasing-the-vat-registration-threshold#summary-of-impacts) from March 2024, which analyzed raising the VAT threshold from £85,000 to £90,000. The OBR certified these costings. [HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-increasing-the-registration-and-deregistration-thresholds/increasing-the-vat-registration-threshold#summary-of-impacts) states directly below the revenue table: "This measure is not expected to have any significant macroeconomic impacts."

The revenue increase in year five requires a different explanation.

## The role of the counterfactual

In a footnote, HMRC refers to a [policy costings document](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65e7920c08eef600155a5617/Published_Costing_Document_Spring_Budget_2024_Final.pdf#page=14) for more detail, but it doesn't shed light on the question. Instead, we must rewind another year to the [March 2023 analysis](https://obr.uk/box/the-impact-of-the-frozen-vat-registration-threshold/) of VAT threshold freezing:

> One of the many aspects of the tax system that is currently subject to a freeze (meaning a threshold is not being raised in line with inflation) is the VAT registration threshold... The threshold has been frozen at that level for eight years, until March 2026. *Our forecast assumes that this freeze will raise £1.4 billion a year in VAT revenues by 2027-28*, by bringing more businesses above the threshold than if the threshold had been indexed to inflation... *compared with indexing the threshold to RPI inflation*.

The baseline freezes the threshold at £85,000 until March 2026, then indexes it to the Retail Price Index (RPI).

## Running the numbers

I couldn't find the government's baseline VAT threshold projections as of March 2024, so I reconstructed them using RPI inflation forecasts from [Table A-1 of their March 2024 Economic and Fiscal Outlook (EFO)](https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-march-2024/#annex-a):

- 2.0% from 2024 to 2025
- 2.5% from 2025 to 2026
- 3.0% from 2026 to 2027

By 2028-29, the baseline threshold reaches £92,000 through inflation indexing. The £90,000 policy threshold is now £2,000 *below* the baseline, generating the £65 million revenue gain—not through economic growth, but by setting a lower threshold than what would have existed under current law.

## Conclusion

Raising the VAT threshold could boost UK growth by reducing tax distortions, cutting administrative burdens, and encouraging business expansion. But the government's projections incorporate none of these effects.

The revenue increase in 2028-29 reflects inflation indexing. The £90,000 threshold generates additional revenue because it's lower than the baseline would be by then—purely a mechanical artifact of how the counterfactual was constructed.

## Analysis of individual income tax provisions in the final reconciliation bill

**Published:** 2025-07-04
**Description:** ### Analysis of individual income tax provisions in the final reconciliation bill

### Analysis of individual income tax provisions in the final reconciliation bill


#### Our simulation projects a reduction in federal revenues of $3.8 trillion from 2026 to 2035 compared to current law.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hjKgHMJLESW4WSfZ)

Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, also known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBB), after the [Senate](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/119th-congress/senate-amendment/2360) amended and approved it on July 1st. The reconciliation package now heads to President Donald Trump’s desk who is expected to sign the legislation into law. [H.R.1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1) extends and expands several provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), while adding new individual income tax provisions such as deductions for tips and overtime.

Applying the PolicyEngine microsimulation model to most of these provisions, we find that the bill’s individual income tax provisions — compared to current law in which Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions expire after 2025 — would:

- Reduce federal revenues by $3.8 trillion between 2026 and 2035
- Benefit 76% of Americans, while reducing net income for 8% of the population in 2026
- Reduce poverty and deep poverty by 5.5% and 6.1%, respectively in 2026
- Increase the Gini index of inequality by 0.4% in 2026

This report details these results and shows the effects on hypothetical households.


### Senate Tax Provisions

While similar to the tax provisions passed by the House of Representatives in May, the final version of the OBBB contains some key differences. In general, the latest bill text makes permanent more tax provisions compared to the bill in May, which implemented temporary boosts throughout the current presidential term. For example, in the bill text from May, the CTC is temporarily boosted to $2,500 before falling to a lower value in 2029. In the latest text, the Child Tax Credit (CTC) is increased to $2,200 and then indexed for inflation thereafter. This shift from temporarily enhancing provisions to permanent increases is also found in the standard deduction provision.

The approved bill also places explicit limits on the tips and overtime income exemptions. In the May draft, both provisions were only accessible to those with less than $160,000 of adjusted gross income. In the final bill text, tips are limited to $25,000 per filer, and the overtime exemption has a cap of $12,500 for single filers and $25,000 for married couples. Each limit then phases down at a 10% rate beginning at $150,000 and $300,000 for single and joint filers, respectively.

The bill versions also treat the state and local tax (SALT) deduction differently. Following a compromise between the House SALT Caucus and Republican leadership, the SALT deduction is set to $40,000 and phased down to $10,000 once adjusted gross income reaches $500,000. This structure was permanent in the May bill text, and each parameter would grow by 1 percent over the budget window in perpetuity. In the final bill, this structure is preserved until 2030, when the SALT cap drops to its current policy value of $10,000.

Compared to the House bill, the final bill also:

- Freezes the first two income tax bracket thresholds from 2025 onwards.
- Requires only one parent to have a valid SSN to claim the CTC (rather than both in the May bill text).
- Resets only the inflation adjustment for the phaseout threshold of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) and increases the phase-out rate to 50%.
- Limits all itemized deductions at the 35% bracket, rather than having a separate limitation at the 32% for the SALT deduction.
- Sets a qualified business income deduction rate of 20% and creates a minimum deduction of $400 for taxpayers with qualified business income of at least $1,000.
- Increases the senior deduction amount to $6,000 and the phaseout rate to 6%.
- Increases the charitable deduction for non-itemizers to $1,000 and $2,000 for joint filers, while also making the provision permanent.
- Increases the maximum match of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and implements a two-tier phase-down structure.
- Excludes 0.5% of a filer’s adjusted gross income from their deductible charitable contributions.

Each of these discussed provisions and all differences between the versions, for all provisions we model, are summarized in Appendix 1. Let’s examine a few household examples to understand the tax provisions’ effect on specific tax units.


### Household impacts

In 2026, when most provisions are active, households would experience a change in net income dependent on their composition and income sources.


#### Elderly couple in Texas

An elderly couple with $80,000 in employment income from Texas would see their [net income rise by $2,835](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=87626&focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54569). While they would benefit from the TCJA extension compared to current law, this couple would also qualify for the additional senior deduction of $12,000 ($6,000 for each elderly member). This paired with existing additional deduction for senior couples ($3,200) and the extension of the TCJA standard deduction ($32,600 in 2026) prevents this couple from paying any income on their first $47,800 of earnings compared to $30,400 under current law.

Figure 1 shows this household’s change in net income over household earnings. Once earnings exceed $30,500, the household begins to see an increase in their net income before plateauing at $48,000. When annual income surpasses $54,500, net income begins to rise again.

**Figure 1: Change in Net Income for a Elderly Couple Between $0 and $200,000 of Earnings (2026)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*4f25YJdN_Haep-Qk)


#### Single undocumented parent in New York

A single parent in New York with two children and $40,000 of earnings would be in line to benefit from the increased CTC compared to current law. However, due to the new SSN requirement for parents under the Senate bill, if they did not have valid SSN, their net income would [fall by $2,335](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=87626&focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54580) as they would become ineligible for the CTC valued at $1,000 per child under current law. The additional loss of $335 stems from their combined personal exemptions and standard deduction under current law exceeding OBBBA’s standard deduction by $3,550. As this makes them face the 10% income bracket, their tax liability increases by $355.

Figure 2 shows that their net income falls at any earnings level between $3,000 and $100,000, and the maximum loss occurs at $45,500 earnings.

**Figure 2: Change in Net Income for an Undocumented Single Parent in New York Between $0 and $200,000 Earnings (2026)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*u0PxhTtBOcZmMdW_)


#### Single adult in Montana with tip income

A single adult from Montana with $50,000 of salaries including $4,000 from tips would [gain $1,903](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=87626&focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54621) from the Senate tax provisions. As the filer’s income falls below the tip income exemption cap, they can fully deduct their $4,000 of tipped income from their federal tax return. In addition to also benefitting from the TCJA extensions, Montana ties its standard deduction to the federal amount by statute, resulting in a lower state tax liability of $731 (included in the total benefit).

Figure 3 shows that the filer’s benefit increases with earnings, for earnings above $8,000.

**Figure 3: Change in Net Income for a Single Adult in Montana with Tip Income, Between $0 and $200,000 Earnings (2026)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*-bXd498VQFidVuKe)


#### High-income couple with two children in California

For a joint filer with two children in California with $1 million of annual income and $60,000 of itemized deductions across several sources, household net income would [drop by $9,627](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=87626&focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54592) compared to current law. While this filer would benefit from the extensions of the reduced income tax rates, floor exclusion of charitable contributions, and the $40,000 SALT cap all reduce the tax savings the household would be eligible under current law.

In Figure 4, the filer from California benefits from the OBBB seeing its highest increase in net income near $505,000 of earnings. However, at higher earnings levels, the bill limits their itemized deductions, resulting in increasing net losses at earnings levels above $885,000 (including those beyond the $2 million viewable area in Figure 4).

**Figure 4: Change in Net Income for a Married Couple of Two Children and Several Itemized Deductions Between $0 and $2 Million of Earnings (2026)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*PnOhbQrRm8wFFp1k)

Table 1 below summarizes each filer’s characteristics and their change in net income for tax year 2026.

### Microsimulation Results


#### Budgetary impact

Using PolicyEngine’s static microsimulation model, we project that the Senate tax provisions of the One Big Beautiful Big Act would cost $3.8 trillion from 2026 to 2035. Additionally, because several proposed changes go into effect in 2025, it would [reduce federal revenues by $63.8 billion](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=87626&focus=policyOutput.budgetaryImpact.overall&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54592) this year.

**Table 2: Annual Federal Revenue Impact of the Income Tax Provisions in the OBBB.**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*x5QXkFbJ3qfde7MMtzOYXg.png)


#### Distributional impact

Our distributional analysis includes the OBBB’s effect on federal taxes, as well as state and local taxes resulting from statutory references to the federal code (e.g., Montana applying the federal standard deduction).

The bill would increase the net income of [76% of US residents](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=87626&focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54592) in 2026. The percentage of U.S. residents would vary by income decile, as the highest income decile would have the highest percentage of residents benefiting at 93.5%, while the lowest would have 33.1% of residents see an increase in their net income. Additionally, 7.7% of the U.S. population would be worse off under the tax provisions in 2026. The reduction of net income for residents can be attributed to the SSN requirements for parents to claim the CTC (mostly affecting lower to middle-income households) and limitations on itemized deductions (mostly affecting higher-income tax units).

**Figure 5: Winners and Losers of the Income Tax Provisions in the OBBB (2026)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*mh1vTI7opHP-XQsL)

In 2026, households in the bottom deciles would gain an average of [$342](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=87626&focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54592), while those in the top decile would gain an average of $13,231.

**Figure 6: Average Household Impact of the Income Tax Provisions in the OBBB (2026)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*19Jo603gE9K6iCTs)

The bill would increase the net income of the top decile by [3.1%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=87626&focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.relative&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54592) on average, the largest gain across deciles.

**Figure 7: Average Relative Household Impact of the Income Tax Provisions in the OBBB (2026)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*wz-eg22GXsF1OdlO)

The OBBB tax provisions would reduce [poverty](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=87626&focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.regular.byAge&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=54592) and [deep poverty](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=87626&focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact.deep.byAge&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps) by 5.5% and 6.1%, respectively. The age group with the largest reduction in poverty would be seniors at 10%, while child poverty would fall by 6.6%, mainly attributable to the increased CTC.

**Figure 8: Poverty Impact of the Income Tax Provisions in the OBBB (2026)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*cp2U8KbQ9fdfftJB)

In terms of [income inequality](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=87626&focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=2&dataset=enhanced_cps), the income tax provisions would increase the Gini index by 0.4% in 2026. Furthermore, the bill increases the top 1%’s net income by 1.9%, less than the overall 2.6%, reducing their share of net income would fall by 0.2%.

**Figure 9: Inequality Impact of the Senate Tax Provisions in the OBBB (2026)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*vclazXXwGlVASvYQ)


### Conclusion

The individual income tax reforms as part of HR 1 would cost $3.8 trillion over the 2026–2035 budget window. Considering the state and local effects, we project the bill to benefit 76% of American residents and reduce net income for 8% of the population; the top income decile gains most on an absolute and relative basis. HR 1 would reduce poverty by 5.5% in 2026, while increasing the Gini index of inequality by 0.4%.

As policymakers evaluate reforms such as these, analytical tools like PolicyEngine offer critical insights into the impacts on diverse household compositions and the broader economy.

## Introducing the obbba household explorer

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/introducing-the-obbba-household-explorer/
**Published:** 2025-07-03
**Description:** ### Introducing the OBBBA Household Explorer

### Introducing the OBBBA Household Explorer


#### New interactive tool reveals household-level impacts of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*xog72axU8gc_8T_x)

Following the Senate’s July 1st passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), we’re launching the [OBBBA Household Explorer](https://policyengine.org/us/obbba-household-explorer) — an interactive dashboard that shows how this reconciliation bill would affect individual households across America.

[Explore Households with our new tool here.](https://policyengine.org/us/obbba-household-explorer)


### What the tool does

The OBBBA Household Explorer allows users to explore the bill’s impacts on over 40,000 representative households from PolicyEngine’s [Enhanced Current Population Survey](https://policyengine.org/us/research/enhanced-cps-beta) (CPS) dataset. This dataset integrates and calibrates multiple data sources using machine learning techniques — the same foundation that powers PolicyEngine’s simulations of policy effects on poverty, inequality, and government budgets, when paired with our comprehensive model of federal, state, and local income tax and benefit programs.

The OBBBA extends provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set to expire at the end of 2025, while introducing new elements including:

- Tax exemptions for tip and overtime income
- Modifications to the Child Tax Credit
- Changes to the SALT deduction cap
- Cuts to SNAP, Medicaid, and Affordable Care Act Premium Tax Credits

By capturing these and more as of 2026, we show the breadth of the bills’ impacts on households that collectively represent the nation.


### Examples

To illustrate the tool’s capabilities, let’s explore two households. While both are couples around 60 years old, varying attributes and analysis configurations shows how results vary.


### Couple in Montana, Senate bill against current law

First consider household **#66994**, a couple in Montana, ages 53 and 61, with $214,850 income.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*femrvCx4TOJ3ea_3)

Comparing the Senate bill to current law, they would gain $13,577, paying $11,831 less in federal tax and $1,746 less in state tax.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*_xZhF7_TUE_RT5Eh)

That $13,577 gain results from reforms to the tax brackets, standard deduction, qualified business income deduction, and overtime income exemption, less a $2,332 loss from the repeal of exemptions.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*42RcvRHuC_8TJdD2)

We can also select state taxes to explore the $1,746 gain, finding that it results from the standard deduction reform. Beginning in 2024, Montana adopted the federal standard deduction by statute. PolicyEngine’s [TAXSIM](http://taxsim.nber.org)-validated tax model captures these interactions between federal and state policy.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*PmdWaNAceYNyVgMW)


### Couple in Georgia, House bill against current policy

Next let’s consider household **#43826**, a Georgia couple with $71,820 income.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*0tcLOTIau2vDApZe)

This household would pay $1,023 less in federal tax, while losing $1,971 in benefits, for a net loss of $947.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*038Eb7mHdWpDA3Kg)

Like the Montana couple, this couple benefits from the standard deduction reform and overtime exemption.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*y8DvE7OXLVAZvd7R)

However, they lose $1,971 in Affordable Care Act Premium Tax Credits, whose enhancements (which are part of current policy) expire at the end of 2025.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*QZQGbe-JhdRw7ifM)

PolicyEngine counts premium tax credits as benefits since they are subsidized premiums throughout the year. Our rules engine calculates these credits to the dollar. Additionally, our rules engine calculates the dollar impacts of households modeled to lose SNAP and Medicaid access, per projections from the Congressional Budget Office.


### Key features

To go beyond these examples (and household **#139385 **for this report’s cover image), you can leverage the tool’s full set of features.


#### 🎲 Quick exploration

The **Get Random Household** button lets you instantly explore impacts across America’s diverse population. Each click reveals a different household, weighted by population representation — allowing rapid exploration of how impacts vary by circumstance.


#### 📊 Comprehensive analysis

The tool analyzes impacts on:

- Federal taxes: Changes from tax rate adjustments, deductions, and credits
- State taxes: How federal changes affect state income tax liability
- Benefits: Changes to programs like SNAP, Medicaid, and ACA subsidies
- Net income: Combined effect on take-home pay


#### 🔍 Detailed filtering

Find households similar to your situation by:

- State
- Income level
- Marital status
- Number of dependents
- Age of household head
- Household weight (population representation)


#### 📈 Provision-by-provision breakdown

Interactive waterfall charts show exactly how each reform component contributes to the total impact:

- Tax rate changes
- Standard deduction modifications
- Child Tax Credit changes
- SALT cap adjustments
- AMT reforms
- Tip and overtime exemptions
- Over a dozen other provisions


#### Multiple baselines and versions

Users can compare impacts against:

- Current law baseline: What happens if TCJA provisions expire
- Current policy baseline: What happens if TCJA provisions are extended

And analyze both:

- House version: Passed May 22, 2025
- Senate version: Passed July 1, 2025


#### Representative data you can trust

The tool uses PolicyEngine’s Enhanced CPS dataset, which represents the full diversity of American households. This allows exploration of impacts across different:

- Geographic regions
- Income levels
- Family structures
- Employment situations
- Benefit receipt patterns

Whether examining a restaurant worker benefiting from tip exemptions, a family affected by Child Tax Credit changes, or a household navigating SALT cap modifications, the tool provides detailed impact analysis.


### Get started

The OBBBA Household Explorer is available now at [policyengine.org/us/obbba-household-explorer](http://policyengine.org/us/obbba-household-explorer)**.**

Start exploring by:

- Using the Get Random Household button to quickly survey diverse impacts
- Applying filters to find households similar to yours
- Selecting specific household IDs for detailed analysis
- Finding “interesting cases” — households with the largest positive or negative impacts

As Congress continues to debate the final form of this legislation, the OBBBA Household Explorer provides a window into how these policy changes would affect real American households.

## AI models favor Cuomo over Mamdani on NYC housing production

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/substack/ai-models-nyc-housing/
**Published:** Jun 23 2025
**Description:** An experiment using six AI models to forecast NYC housing production under two mayoral candidates.

I spent the weekend in New York City, where canvassers requested my vote for Tuesday's primary election at least a dozen times. While New Yorkers will vote on several offices, most of the energy went to the ranked-choice mayoral, where prediction markets call it a two-candidate race: former governor [Andrew Cuomo](https://www.andrewcuomo.com/) leads Assemblymember [Zohran Mamdani](https://www.zohranfornyc.com/) with roughly 2:1 odds of victory ([73% chance of winning on Manifold](https://manifold.markets/HillaryClinton/who-will-be-the-democratic-nyc-mayo), [70% on Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/event/who-will-win-dem-nomination-for-nyc-mayor), and [69% on Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/markets/kxmayornycnomd/new-york-city-mayoral-nominations)).

Returning to my home in Washington, it struck me that I hadn't yet seen a quantitative analysis of the leading candidates' housing plans. Indeed, two main housing supply advocacy organizations—[Open New York](https://opennewyork.org/endorsements/) and [NYC New Liberals](https://www.nycnewliberals.org/2025-voting-guide)—declined to endorse either Cuomo or Mamdani. What if frontier AI models could fill the gap?

My experiment started with creating two prediction markets on [Manifold Markets](http://manifold.markets) asking how many housing units NYC would have by 2029—the final year of the four-year term—conditional on either Andrew Cuomo or Zohran Mamdani winning the mayoral election. I then provided six AI models with the market text and requested probability distributions:

- OpenAI o3-pro (normal and deep research versions)
- Anthropic Claude 4 Opus (normal and deep research versions)
- Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (normal and deep research versions)

## Key findings

**Housing stock predictions (2029):**
- Cuomo scenario: 3,924,000 homes
- Mamdani scenario: 3,869,000 homes
- Difference: 55,000 more units under Cuomo

**Growth comparison (from 2023 baseline of 3,705,000 homes):**
- Cuomo growth: 219,000 units (5.91%)
- Mamdani growth: 164,000 units (4.43%)
- **Result: 34% more growth under Cuomo**

Because the mayor takes office in January 2026, and the survey is conducted January-June 2029, this provides approximately 3.25 years of mayoral influence. Any growth occurring between the 2023 survey and the election may not be attributable to the election, and it would dilute the delta in growth. Alternatively, we can estimate the baseline growth excluding projected growth from 2023 to 2026. Assuming growth continues at the 27,500/year pace of [2022](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2022.B25001?g=160XX00US3651000) to [2023](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2023.B25001?g=160XX00US3651000) (per the American Community Survey), NYC is "nowcasted" to have 3,760,450 homes at the beginning of 2025. The growth over the term then falls to 164,000 under Cuomo and 109,000 under Mamdani: **50% more growth under Cuomo**.

## Model variation

Model predictions differed significantly:
- OpenAI o3-pro without Deep Research: 75,000 unit advantage for Cuomo
- OpenAI o3-pro with Deep Research: 36,000 unit advantage
- Google Gemini 2.5 Pro projected larger differentials than Anthropic Claude 4 Opus

## Factors identified

**General growth drivers:**
- Existing 421-a pipeline projects
- 1.4% vacancy rate (lowest since 1968)
- City of Yes zoning reforms (~5,500 units/year)
- Expected declining interest rates

**Cuomo-specific factors:**
- 467-m office conversion incentive
- Real estate industry relationships
- Proposed $5 billion capital fund

**Mamdani-specific factors:**
- 200,000 public units over 10 years
- Rent freeze on stabilized units
- Requires state approval for $70 billion financing

## Conclusion

I've increasingly found that AI models give more thorough responses when prompted with quantitative exercises like these, whether for [trade deficit policies](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maxghenis_what-happens-when-you-give-an-ai-economist-activity-7325825369821884416-WUAN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAHRBmABgFgIdjcDFs-ZD8yHUI3Rd1pqlWY) or [sleep therapies](https://x.com/MaxGhenis/status/1929213247443423622). For AIs and humans alike, forecasting forces one to identify the most relevant evidence to explore the dynamics at play—and to recognize that magnitudes matter.

Time will tell how accurate the AIs' predictions are. For now, I'm giving my mana as a proxy for their forecasts; if you disagree, I invite you to bet against them.

## Ways and means committee’s SALT cap

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/ways-and-means-committees-salt-cap/
**Published:** 2025-05-14
**Description:** ### Ways and Means Committee’s SALT Cap

### Ways and Means Committee’s SALT Cap


#### We project that limiting state and local tax deductions to $30,000, phasing down to $10,000 at high incomes, would raise $937 billion over the budget window.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*B5J9NjfAtTTAmtll)

Earlier today, the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives voted in favor of [“The One, Big, Beautiful Bill”,](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SMITMO_017_xml.pdf) a suite of tax reforms that extends most provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, while adding other reforms such as exempting tip and overtime income from taxes. Among its changes from TCJA is a higher limit on the state and local tax deduction, which is $10,000 under TCJA and uncapped after 2025 under current law. The bill caps the SALT deduction at $30,000 for taxpayers, phasing down to $10,000 for filers with income above $400,000.

We modeled the impact of this policy against a baseline with most other provisions of the Ways & Means Committee’s bill.

Key results (static):

- Raises federal revenues by $937 billion from 2026 to 2035
- Reduces net income for 5.2% of Americans in 2026
- Increases the Supplemental Poverty Measure by 0.2%
- Lowers the Gini index of income inequality by 0.4%

*Use PolicyEngine to *[view the full results](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=84044&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84050&dataset=enhanced_cps)* or calculate the *[effect on your household](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=84044&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84050&dataset=enhanced_cps)*.*


### Summary of SALT Provisions

The SALT deduction is set to become uncapped starting in 2026 after being limited to $10,000 under the TCJA. Under the Ways and Means bill, the SALT deduction would be capped at $30,000 ($15,000 for separate filers). As Figure 1 shows, once adjusted gross income reaches $400,000 ($200,000 for separate filers), the limitation phases down at a 20% rate until reaching $10,000 ($5,000 for separate filers). This results in filers with AGI above $500,000 ($250,000 separate) facing the SALT cap floor.

**Figure 1: SALT Cap Under Ways and Means Bill**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*IUqgwWeJcKNFL00U)


### Household Impacts

As we are only comparing how the SALT deduction would affect households as a part of the full bill, only households that itemize their deductions and have state and local tax expenses would be affected. For example, a single adult in New York making $500,000 and $45,000 in property taxes would see a [reduction in their net income of $21,053](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=84044&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84050&dataset=enhanced_cps&household=53326) in 2026. Figure 1 displays how the single adult’s net income would change as their household earnings vary. While rising at certain points, net income generally falls as household income increases.

**Figure 2: Effect of the SALT Limitation on Net Income Based on Household Earnings for a Single Filer with $30,000+ in SALT (2026)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1nGgDnLbZjpbceXY)

The introduction of the cap would affect the single adult’s marginal tax rates (MTRs) at various earnings levels, as shown in Figure 3. This reveals that, for instance, the phase-out beginning at $400,000 income increases the filer’s MTR by 7 percentage points. While the SALT cap phases out over the $400,000 to $500,000 income range, it only increases the MTR for the income range from $400,000 to $470,000, since the filer would take the $16,200 standard deduction once the SALT cap falls below this amount.

**Figure 3: Change in Marginal Tax Rates Based on Household Earnings for a Single Filer with $30,000+ in SALT (2026)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2xwAC1TJdwR9oL27)

As a result of the SALT cap phase-out, the total marginal tax rate reaches 51.2% for earnings between $400,000 to $470,000.

### Microsimulation Results

Using PolicyEngine’s static microsimulation model, we project that the $30,000 SALT cap would increase federal revenues by $937 billion over the next ten years (2026–2035). For comparison, the Joint Committee on Taxation [projected](https://www.jct.gov/publications/2025/jcx-22-25r/) that it would raise $916 billion from 2025–2034.

**Table 1: Annual Federal Budgetary Impact of the SALT Cap Under the W&M Bill**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*j7c-fhvg0vg010nffy9H1g.png)

The SALT cap would [reduce the net income of 5.2% of American residents](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=84044&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84050&dataset=enhanced_cps) in 2026. The top income decile would see the greatest number of residents who are made worse off by the SALT cap.

**Figure 5: Distribution of the SALT Cap Under the W&M Bill (2026)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*bitAetgKi4pRc7eH)

Households in the top decile would pay an average of [$4,405 more](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=84044&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84050&dataset=enhanced_cps) in taxes, a larger amount than other deciles.

**Figure 6: Average Impact of the SALT Cap Under the W&M Bill (2026)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*FvD1qldxcKtrGUPm)

When it comes to poverty and inequality, the SALT cap would, in 2026:

- Increase poverty (as defined by the Supplemental Poverty Measure) by 0.02%,
- Increase deep poverty and deep child poverty by 0.06% and 0.11%, respectively,
- Reduce the Gini index of inequality by 0.4%, and the top 1%’s share of net income by 1.0%


### Conclusion

Conditional on other provisions in the Ways and Means Committee’s bill, we find that its SALT cap raises federal revenues by $937 billion over ten years, assuming no behavioral responses. Our projection exceeds JCT’s by 2.2%, though we score from 2026–2035 rather than 2025–2034. The limitation would reduce the after-tax incomes of 5% of the population in 2026, with households in the top income decile experiencing the greatest losses on an [absolute basis](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.distributionalImpact.incomeDecile.average&reform=84044&region=us&timePeriod=2026&baseline=84050&dataset=enhanced_cps). The $30,000 cap is projected to increase poverty by 0.02%, while lowering the Gini index by 0.4%.

As policymakers evaluate reforms such as these, analytical tools like PolicyEngine offer critical insights into the impacts on diverse household compositions and the broader economy.

## What will the House Ways & Means Committee propose on Tuesday?

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/substack/house-ways-means-tuesday/
**Published:** May 12 2025
**Description:** Analysis of the proposed individual income tax reforms and what the markup process will look like.

Late Friday, May 9, House Ways & Means [released](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/event/full-committee-markup-of-legislative-proposals-to-comply-with-the-reconciliation-directive-included-in-section-2001-of-the-concurrent-resolution-on-the-budget-for-fiscal-year-2025-h-con-res-14) a 28-page committee print that would make these individual income tax reforms. The [Joint Committee on Taxation](https://www.jct.gov/publications/2025/jcx-19-25) puts the conventional revenue effect at **-$4.9 trillion through 2035** compared against current law, in which TCJA expires after 2025.

## Proposed tax reforms

The committee print includes several key modifications:

- **TCJA Extension**: Make permanent the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's lower rate schedule, alternative minimum tax structure, and estate tax thresholds
- **Standard Deduction**: Enlarge the standard deduction from 2025-2028 while keeping personal and dependent exemptions repealed
- **Child Tax Credit**: Increase to $2,500 for 2025-2028, then return to indexed $2,000 levels, requiring Social Security Numbers for parents and children
- **Pass-Through Deduction**: Raise the §199A deduction rate to 22 percent

## Missing campaign proposals

Absent from the print were policies President Donald Trump discussed on the campaign trail: the [state and local tax deduction](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-calls-undoing-part-tax-law-vowing-get-salt-back-rcna171513), [taxation of Social Security benefits](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/politics/social-security-benefits-tax-trump/index.html), [tips](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/platform), and [overtime pay](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/79baa3f9-c3c0-448a-8feb-15ba75edde43), and a potential [deduction for auto-loan interest](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/trump-speaks-at-event-in-detroit-michigan).

That said, they might still show up on Tuesday. Here's how the markup will work:

1. Staff post an *amendment in the nature of a substitute* (AINS) Monday night or Tuesday morning.
2. At 2 p.m. ET (May 13) the Committee meets, adopts the AINS as base text and considers member amendments.
3. The bill reported at adjournment—whatever changes are adopted—is what moves to the House floor and will form the basis for Senate negotiations.

## Five fresh Manifold markets to prepare for Tuesday

Analysts across the country are currently preparing for the full markup on Tuesday. At [PolicyEngine](http://policyengine.org), we're guessing what we can test and bolster in our simulation system to contribute evidence on Tuesday's final proposals.

The SALT cap may be the most watched decision point. It's also the most complex market: Tuesday will tell us the new SALT cap, with NY Republicans having [reportedly rejected](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/08/congress/ny-republicans-say-they-rejected-30k-salt-offer-calling-it-insulting-00336993) $30,000 doubled for married filers. Some have betted against a Social Security tax exemption showing up. And betted against a tip exclusion as well. But of the full exclusions, Manifold users find overtime the least likely. Users also think an auto-loan interest deduction unlikely.

## Where the wider betting market stands

These are the only markets I'm aware of targeting Tuesday's markup, but others are looking further down the road:

- **Kalshi** puts a [71% chance](https://kalshi.com/markets/kxrecbill/reconciliation-bill-parts) *no tax on tips* becoming law before 2026 and an 83% chance the SALT cap rises above $10k, with [another market](https://kalshi.com/markets/kxsalt/salt-tax-cap-raised) giving a 45% chance it's raised above $30k.
- **Polymarket** sees a [34% chance](https://polymarket.com/event/trump-ends-taxes-on-tips-before-august) tips are untaxed by August, and a [73% chance](https://polymarket.com/event/reconciliation-bill-passed-by?tid=1746980401267) a reconciliation bill clears both chambers by the end of August.
- **Manifold** there's a [47% probability](https://manifold.markets/MaxGhenis/when-will-tcja-tax-cuts-and-jobs-ac) that Congress renegotiates and extends TCJA in the second half of 2025.

## Coming next from PolicyEngine

As soon as the committee reports its bill Tuesday, we will:

1. Update our microsimulation to reflect any changes.
2. Publish new revenue and distribution tables.
3. Refresh our household calculator so you can see the impact on your own taxes.

Until then, place your bets and watch Tuesday's markup—prediction markets will be moving in real time.

## My 2024 in code: Personal projects and AI tools

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/substack/my-2024-in-code/
**Published:** Jan 02 2025
**Description:** How AI helped me build useful software while leading PolicyEngine.

As 2024 drew to a close, I reflected on my coding journey. Leading PolicyEngine meant less time programming, but I still maintained 3,721 GitHub contributions last year (down from ~4,500 in prior years), spanning collaborations, third-party contributions, and personal projects.

While most of those contributions went to PolicyEngine's core software, where I continue to review code and build with our growing team (see our 2024 year-in-review posts for the [US](https://policyengine.org/us/research/us-year-in-review-2024) and [UK](https://policyengine.org/uk/research/uk-year-in-review-2024)), 2024 was also my most enjoyable and productive year of coding, thanks largely to AI tools like Claude. Here are some of the projects I built alongside our main work:

## CodeStitch

[codestitch.dev](https://codestitch.dev) stitches GitHub repos, PRs, and issues into single text files to make it easier to give code as context to AI assistants. It started as a Streamlit app and evolved into a React application in December. If you've ever tried to get AI help with a codebase, you know the pain of context limitations—CodeStitch helps solve that.

## PR Improver

[pr-improver.streamlit.app](https://pr-improver.streamlit.app) suggests improvements to pull requests using LLMs and the GitHub API, comparing against contributor guidelines in the repo. While it currently only works with PolicyEngine repos (since each run costs us money), I'm planning to add support for other repos where you can bring your own LLM API key.

## OEWS Explorer

[oews-explorer.streamlit.app](https://oews-explorer.streamlit.app) helps explore the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics by occupation and geography. I built it to support PolicyEngine's NSF grant application, but it's also useful for compensation research.

## Personal website

I refreshed [maxghenis.com](https://maxghenis.com) with React, creating a cleaner, more maintainable platform for sharing my work and writing.

## Looking forward

AI has transformed programming more than any field I've encountered. You can now ideate, prototype, and build with unprecedented speed and creativity. Tools like Claude and Cursor don't just help you debug—they're collaborative partners in the development process, helping you explore architectural decisions, discover edge cases, and learn new frameworks.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or curious leader, I highly recommend making time for coding in 2025. You might surprise yourself with what you build. I'm excited to share more projects in the coming year!

Want to explore these tools? Check out the links above and let me know what you think—they're all open source. And if you're interested in contributing to PolicyEngine, we're always looking for collaborators—drop by our [GitHub repos](https://github.com/PolicyEngine).

## Elon Musk's AI predicts Americans will be $800 richer under Harris

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/elon-musk-ai-harris/
**Published:** Nov 04 2024
**Description:** A large-scale experiment asking leading AI models to forecast key economic metrics under different presidential administrations.

I conducted a large-scale experiment asking leading AI models to forecast key economic metrics for 2025 under different administrative scenarios. The research validates that these models can make meaningful economic predictions when properly prompted.

## Key findings

Musk's Grok AI produced notably optimistic projections for a Harris administration across tested metrics:

- **Air quality:** PM2.5 pollution would be 1.51 µg/m³ lower than under Trump (GPT-4o predicted 1.26)
- **Poverty:** Supplemental Poverty Measure 3.42 percentage points lower (vs GPT-4o's 1.76)
- **Individual prosperity:** Real GDP per capita $802 higher (vs GPT-4o's $388)

Grok's predictions exceeded GPT-4o's by factors ranging from 1.2x to 2.1x, with statistically significant differences.

## Methodology

I ran 500 trials for each model and metric using their APIs. Results remained stable across different prompting approaches. The study employed narrative prompting techniques, asking models to describe scenarios from a future perspective.

## Context and purpose

This project originated at a Manifold Markets event discussing political forecasting. Even GPT-4o-mini's more conservative estimates showed similar directional patterns.

## Broader implications

I work at PolicyEngine, which builds microsimulation models estimating how specific tax and benefit policies affect household budgets. These AI forecasts raise interesting questions about complementing precise policy analysis with broader contextual insights.

## How the rent relief act of 2019 varies with income and location

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/how-the-rent-relief-act-of-2019-varies-with-income/
**Published:** 2024-08-22
**Description:** ### How the Rent Relief Act of 2019 Varies with Income and Location

### How the Rent Relief Act of 2019 Varies with Income and Location


#### We show the impact on different households of the bill introduced by then-Senator Kamala Harris.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1tDL5nfwwLuqMVIH)

Kamala Harris on Friday released her [economic plan](https://mailchi.mp/press.kamalaharris.com/vice-president-harris-lays-out-agenda-to-lower-costs-for-american-families), including an expanded Child Tax Credit we [analyzed](https://policyengine.org/us/research/harris-ctc) on Saturday. Absent from the housing portion of her plan was legislation she introduced in 2018 and 2019 as a Senator: the Rent Relief Act (RRA), a refundable tax credit based on income, rent paid, and local housing costs. In this post, we use the PolicyEngine model to explore its effects on different household types, and how it situates with other tax and benefit programs. We focus on a typical example, as well as two ends of the credit’s generosity spectrum, based on local housing costs, at which the bill caps countable rent.


### Legislative History

While Harris introduced the RRA in the Senate in 2018 and then 2019, the bill dates back to 2017 and continues to be active:

- 2017: Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-NY) introduced the initial version with eight cosponsors.
- 2018: Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA) reintroduced it in the House; Sen. Kamala Harris introduced a Senate companion bill.
- 2019: Sen. Harris and Rep. Danny Davis (D-IL) reintroduced it in the Senate and House, respectively, reducing the maximum rent from 150% to 100% of fair market rent.
- 2022: Rep. Davis and Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) reintroduced the bill.
- 2023: Rep. Davis reintroduced it without a Senate companion.

The bill has not changed since 2019, and all 25 cosponsors in the latest House bill are Democrats.


### Mechanics of the Proposed Credit

The RRA establishes a refundable tax credit based on household income, rent paid, and local housing costs. The bill defines local housing costs from Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs), which HUD [sets](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr/fmrs/FY2024_code/2024summary_sa.odn) at the 40th percentile of rents in each ZIP code, broken down by the number of bedrooms. HUD publishes these SAFMRs annually, and [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tH3NQXmLisDgxjl0WUbnQvS05OskAKI27Lk1gIOsfA4/edit?usp=sharing) shows them for 2024.

Key features of the credit:

- Covers a percentage of rent exceeding 30% of the household’s gross income
- Percentage decreases as income increases, according to the following schedule: 100% for incomes up to $25,000, 75% for incomes over $25,000 but not over $50,000, 50% for incomes over $50,000 but not over $75,000, 25% for incomes over $75,000 but not over $100,000, 0% for incomes over $100,000
- Thresholds are $25,000 higher in areas that use SAFMRs instead of FMRs (which HUD defines at the metro level) for the Housing Choice Voucher program
- Uses SAFMRs to determine maximum allowable rent for credit calculation
- Alternate rules for residents of public housing (not modeled in this piece)
- Credit is refundable, meaning it can exceed the amount of taxes owed

This structure creates a varying impact on households depending on their income, rent, and location. The subsequent sections will explore these impacts through specific examples.


### Examples of Credit Application


#### A Typical Example: Sherman-Denison, Texas

Consider a single parent with two children living in ZIP code 75459 in Sherman-Denison, Texas, an area with SAFMRs close to the median that does not use SAFMRs for the HCV program. Suppose this household pays $1,500 per month in rent for their three-bedroom home, less than the $1,590 per month SAFMR. Suppose further that they earn $40,000 per year. The credit would cover 75% of the difference between their rent ($18,000) exceeding 30% of their income ($12,000), or 75% of $6,000 which is $4,500.

We can see this visually by displaying the credit with earnings, showing the steps at $25,000 and $50,000, and their ineligibility at $60,000 income (30% of which is $1,500 per month).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*_bG50g06m6fg3p2c)

The steps at $25,000 and $50,000 income create cliffs. Combined with other tax and benefit programs, the household would have a lower net income if earning between $25,000 and $48,000.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*EPuCVy97aGQvFyUk)


#### The low end: Missouri studios

HUD has designated the country’s lowest SAFMR as studios in a set of ZIPs in central Missouri, at $540 per month. Consider an [individual](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&household=46651&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&reform=63509) living in a studio apartment in this area paying $600 per month:

- If their income is $0, they would receive the full $540 per month ($6,480 annually) as a credit.
- As their income increases, the credit phases out at a 30% rate.
- At $21,600 annual income (30% of which is $540 per month), they would no longer be eligible for the credit.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*aWj1gSnt06wvXQAS)

As their baseline marginal tax rate ranges from 0% to 62% in this range, the RRA [increases it](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&household=46651&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&reform=63509) to between 30% and 92%.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*TVnDJ119xe338vNK)


#### The high end: San Diego four-bedroom homes

The country’s highest SAFMR is 4bd in several areas in San Diego: $6,960. This is also an area where SAFMR is used for HCV, raising RRA income thresholds by $25,000.

Consider a [married couple](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&household=46575&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&reform=63509) with three children paying at least $6,960 per month in rent in a 4bd home in one of these areas. If they have no income, they will receive the full $6,960 per month, or $83,520 per year. That will phase out at a 30% rate, until they earn $50,000, at which point the credit covers 75%, rather than 100%, of the gap between rent and 30% of their income. It then steps down again at $75,000, $100,000, and finally $125,000 income at which point they become ineligible.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*IUCRsmREyRmi5cj-)

While the credit phases out at a 30% rate for any segment, it creates a higher average marginal tax rate over the full earnings range due to the steps: by reducing the credit from $83,520 to $0 over the earnings range $0 to $125,000, it adds 67 percentage points to their marginal tax rate.

Stacking the credit atop other tax and benefit programs for this household reveals its effect on cliffs. Accounting for state and federal income taxes, and benefits like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the household faces a baseline average marginal tax rate of 38% from $0 to $125,000: they receive $22,817 at zero earnings and $100,351 at $125,000. The RRA thus increases their MTR to 105% over this range; their net income is $106,337 at zero earnings and $100,351 at $125,000.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*laJ8B-XezYYRjNIA)

It’s worth noting that the bill does not set a maximum number of bedrooms based on household size, unlike the [Housing Choice Voucher](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PIH/documents/HCV_Guidebook_Calculating_Rent_and_HAP_Payments.pdf#page=7) program. This means the San Diego example could theoretically apply to a single individual living in a four-bedroom home.


### Conclusion

The Rent Relief Act (RRA) of 2019 proposes a refundable tax credit that would have varying impacts on renter households across the United States. This analysis demonstrates several key aspects of the bill’s potential effects:

- Geographic Variation: The credit’s value differs based on location due to its reliance on Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs). As shown in the examples, the maximum credit ranges from $540 per month in low-cost areas of Missouri to $6,960 per month in high-cost areas of San Diego.
- Income-Based Phase-Out: The credit’s structure, with its stepped percentage reductions at specific income thresholds, creates a set of incentives that vary with household income. This design leads to cliff effects at $25,000 income increments, where increases in earnings can result in decreases in credit amount.
- Interaction with Existing Programs: When combined with other tax and benefit programs, the RRA can alter marginal tax rates. In some cases, as demonstrated in the San Diego example, this can lead to situations where households may face high marginal tax rates or see their net income decrease as their earnings increase.
- Rent-to-Income Ratio: The credit’s design targets households paying more than 30% of their income in rent, with the largest benefits going to those with the highest rent burdens relative to their incomes.
- Potential Locational Incentives: By tying the credit amount to local rent levels, the RRA could potentially influence household decisions about where to live.
- Flexibility in Unit Size: Unlike some housing assistance programs, the RRA does not limit unit size based on household composition.

These features of the Rent Relief Act illustrate the various factors involved in designing housing assistance policies that aim to address affordability issues across diverse housing markets and household types. The bill’s impacts would likely vary depending on local housing costs, household incomes, and interactions with existing social programs.

In modeling the program’s effects, it is important to consider these incentive effects. Given our recent work integrating labor supply responses in microsimulations, we plan to examine the literature around migration to incorporate this into future analysis. This approach will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of how the RRA might influence both employment decisions and geographical mobility.

Further research could explore the potential effects of the RRA on rental markets, including possible impacts on rent levels and housing supply. Additionally, analysis of the bill’s budgetary implications and its effects on poverty rates and housing stability across different demographic groups could provide insights for understanding the full scope of the proposed legislation.

**Published:** 2024-08-21
**Description:** ### Individual Income Tax Provisions in Minnesota Bill HF1938 (2023)

### Individual Income Tax Provisions in Minnesota Bill HF1938 (2023)


#### The reform signed by Governor Tim Walz expanded credits for low-income families, reduced taxes for middle-income retirees, and raised taxes for high-income filers.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*f0CxjrDF2cXDtxCv)

In March 2023, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz signed into law [HF1938](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=HF1938&version=4&session=ls93&session_year=2023&session_number=0&format=pdf), a tax reform bill that modifies several aspects of the state’s tax code. The legislation introduces changes to family tax credits, retirement benefit subtractions, and deductions for high-income taxpayers.

PolicyEngine’s static microsimulation results for 2023 project that HF1938’s individual income tax provisions:

- Cost $444 million
- Reduced poverty by 2% and child poverty by 9%
- Increased net income for 22% and reduced net income for 4% of Minnesotans
- Lowered the Gini index of income inequality by 0.9%

This report describes provisions of HF1938, illustrates the impacts with hypothetical households, and summarizes projected Minnesota-wide impacts.

[See the Minnesota impacts](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=2&focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&region=mn&timePeriod=2023&baseline=63889&household=46737)

[See how HF1938 would affect your own household](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=2&focus=intro&region=mn&timePeriod=2023&baseline=63889)


### Provisions of HF1938

HF1938 expanded low-income tax credits, adjusted retirement income subtractions, and reduced standard and itemized deductions for high-income filers. It also included several provisions PolicyEngine does not currently model, including property tax adjustments as well as education tax credit.


#### Working Families Tax Credit

The new law introduces a combined Child and Working Family Tax Credit, replacing the previous Working Family Credit (which resembled the federal Earned Income Tax Credit) and adding a new child tax credit (CTC) component:


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xVwIvcAXuZm5NmtzTZuJEA.png)


#### Introduces Retirement Benefits Subtraction for Public Sector Pensions

- Subtracts up to $12,500 ($25,000 married) in public sector pension benefits from state adjusted gross income
- Phases out at 5% of income above $78,000 ($100,000 married)


#### Expands Social Security Subtraction

- Increased the maximum amount of Social Security benefits subtracted from state adjusted gross income from $4,020 to $4,560 ($5,150 to $5,840 married)
- Increased reduction thresholds from $61,080 to $69,250 ($78,180 to $88,630 married)
- Maintains $40,000 phase-out window (10% per $4,000 income above the threshold)


#### Expands Child and Dependent Care Credit (CDCC)

- Made married filing separately filers eligible for the state CDCC


#### Further Reduces Standard and Itemized Deductions for High Income Filers

- Adds two new reductions to standard and itemized deductions for high-income filers, atop the existing reduction equal to 3% of income above $110,325 ($220,650 married): 10% of income over $304,970 and 80% of income over $1,000,000


### Household Impacts


#### Child and Working Family Credit

The new Child and Working Family Tax Credit provides over $3,385 to eligible Minnesota households. For instance, a single parent with two children (ages 10 and 5) earning $30,000 now receives an additional [$1,656](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=2&focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=mn&timePeriod=2023&baseline=63889&household=46721) in refundable credits under the new structure.

The following graph shows the Credit amount change for a married couple with two children as well as for a single parent:

**Figure 1: Credit amount comparison of the Working Family Credit and the new Child and Working Family Credit on a couple and single parent of two (10 and 5) (2023)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*NTzfwwf6k2PVGxpq)

Looking at the [net impact](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=2&focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=mn&timePeriod=2024&baseline=63834&household=46680), this household could receive up to an additional $3,500 due to the removal of the general earnings requirements for the Child Tax Credit component. The impact gradually reduces as the previous Working Family Credit phases in and spikes once more due to the delayed reduction start.

**Figure 2: Net income impact of the Minnesota Bill HF1938 on a single parent of two (10 and 5) with earnings up to $100k (2023)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*GJSskNDoNTqey6n8)

The credit change also impacts [marginal tax rates](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=2&focus=householdOutput.mtr&region=mn&timePeriod=2024&baseline=63834&household=46680) for the given family. The marginal tax rates increase by as much as 12 percentage points for earnings between $50,000 and $62,000.

**Figure 3: Marginal Tax Rate changes under the Minnesota Bill HF1938 on a single parent of two (10 and 5) (2023)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*eSBqpQM51uN6veYk)


#### Standard deduction reduction

Zooming out, we can see that the reform reduces [this household’s](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=2&focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=mn&timePeriod=2024&baseline=63834&household=46745) standard deduction for earnings between $310,000 and $775,000.

Figure 4: How Minnesota Bill HF1938 (2023) affects a joint filer’s standard deduction


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2DLAosGOytyh8SuP)

Accordingly, the reform increases this household’s taxes by as much as $966, for earnings of $445,000.

**Figure 4: Net income impact of the Minnesota Bill HF1938 on a single parent of two (10 and 5) with earnings up to $800k (2023)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*6dlFo_YMTdbifJui)


#### Social Security and public pension subtractions

To illustrate the changes to the subtractions for Social Security benefits public pensions, consider an individual receiving $25,000 in public pensions (for example, from teaching in public schools) and $20,000 in Social Security benefits. These are both roughly average values. This individual would pay up to $1,500 less in [income tax](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=2&focus=householdOutput.netIncome&region=mn&timePeriod=2023&baseline=63889&household=46737) due to the newly introduced public retirement income subtraction and the adjusted social security income subtraction.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ExCR_GL_u6VfJ3oj)


### Microsimulation Results

PolicyEngine’s US microsimulation model (version 1.57.1), run over the indexed 2022 Current Population Survey March Supplement for 2023, reveals several key impacts of HF1938’s individual income tax provisions:

- Costs $444 million
- Lowers Minnesota’s Supplemental Poverty Measure by 1.9%, including 9.4% for children and 45.6% for deep child poverty
- Reduces income inequality in Minnesota: the Gini index falls 0.8%, while the net income share held by the top 1% and 10% each fall 0.2%

[22%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=2&focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&region=mn&timePeriod=2023&baseline=63889) of residents will experience an increase in their after-tax income due to these changes, including 35% of those in the bottom income decile. Conversely, 4% of residents will see a reduction in their after-tax income, including 38% of those in the top income decile.

**Figure 6: Winners and Losers from the Minnesota Bill HF1938 by Decile (2023)**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*nI9I5cjBOwe0Ijwl)

These results assume no behavioral responses.


### Conclusion

The Minnesota tax reform bill HF1938 introduces changes to the state’s tax structure, particularly in areas of family tax credits, retirement benefits, and deductions for high-income earners.

The microsimulation results suggest that these reforms will reduce inequality and poverty, especially among children. The changes in tax credits and deductions create a mixed effect across income levels, with a majority of residents seeing increased after-tax income, while a smaller percentage, primarily in higher income brackets, experience reductions.

## Kamala harris’s child tax credit proposal

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/kamala-harriss-child-tax-credit-proposal/
**Published:** 2024-08-18
**Description:** ### Kamala Harris’s Child Tax Credit Proposal

### Kamala Harris’s Child Tax Credit Proposal


#### We analyze the Democratic nominee’s proposal to expand the 2021 expansion, giving $6,000 to parents of newborns.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*RCdaBmejDHqhVFm0)

The Kamala Harris campaign yesterday released an [economic policy agenda](https://mailchi.mp/press.kamalaharris.com/vice-president-harris-lays-out-agenda-to-lower-costs-for-american-families) spanning housing, healthcare, grocery costs, and taxes. Her tax plan led with a pledge to “restore the American Rescue Plan’s expanded Child Tax Credit” and provide “up to $6,000 in total tax relief for middle-income and low-income families for the first year of their child’s life.”

Using the PolicyEngine model, we estimate that this Child Tax Credit expansion would have these effects in 2025:

- Cost $117 billion
- Benefit 44% of the population
- Cut child poverty 31%
- Lower the Gini index of income inequality by 1.4%

While these effects assume no behavioral responses, the projected cost rises about five percent when applying elasticities from the Congressional Budget Office.

[See how Kamala Harris’ Child Tax Credit proposal would affect you.](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=63712&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us)* (Make sure to select ***2025***.)*


### The Child Tax Credit

The Child Tax Credit (CTC) currently provides up to $2,000 per child, with a partially refundable structure; that is, filers without tax liability can claim only part of the credit — currently, $1,700. Low-income parents who don’t benefit from the full non-refundable credit can receive the Additional Child Tax Credit, which phases in with earnings above $2,500. The credit begins to phase out at incomes of $200,000 for single parents (head of household filers) and $400,000 for joint filers.

In 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) temporarily expanded the CTC, increasing the maximum credit to $3,600 for children under 6 and $3,000 for older children, making it fully refundable, and introducing an additional phase-out for higher-income households. We’ve previously analyzed the impacts of the [current CTC](https://policyengine.org/us/research/the-child-tax-credit-in-2023), [restoring the ARPA expansion](https://policyengine.org/us/research/restoration-of-the-american-rescue-plan-acts-expanded-child-tax-credit), and the [Biden-Harris 2025 budget proposal](https://policyengine.org/us/research/biden-budget-2025), which also included restoring this expanded CTC.


### The Harris Plan

Kamala Harris has now proposed not only restoring the ARPA expansion but also adding a “baby bonus” of $2,400 for children in their first year of life, bringing the total credit to $6,000 for newborns. While she has not yet detailed the baby bonus mechanism, we assume it follows the [American Family Act of 2023](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3899), which had 211 cosponsors in the House (all Democrats) and phased out the baby bonus with the ARPA expansion.


### Household Impacts

Consider a parent, or parents, with no earnings who bear a newborn. Under current law, they would receive no Child Tax Credit, since they have no tax liability for the non-refundable $2,000 credit to count against, nor do they have the earnings for the Additional Child Tax Credit (refundable component) to phase in with. Under Harris’s proposal, they would receive the full $6,000 baby bonus, adding $6,000 to their net income.

As this household’s earnings rise, the net benefit falls: while they receive $6,000 under Harris’ plan, the difference is less as they would be entitled to more of a credit under current law. While Harris hasn’t specified the “middle-income and low-income families” who would be eligible, we assume the additional credit phases out with the rest of the ARPA CTC, as House Democrats designed the 2023 American Family Act to do.

Broadening the picture, we can view how this household and others with one child would benefit, depending on their marital status and the child’s age.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Hi7zttzYhstumibz)

The maximum benefit varies with the child’s age: $6,000 for newborns, $3,600 for children age one to five, and $3,000 for children ages 6 to 17. Since 17-year-olds are ineligible under current law, they see a larger benefit. Married parents benefit more in some earnings ranges for two reasons:

- Their higher standard deduction reduces their tax liability under current law, which requires them to have higher earnings to benefit from the non-refundable CTC
- The Harris CTC expansion phases out at a higher income level for married filers compared to single (head of household) filers


### Microsimulation Results

Using PolicyEngine’s US microsimulation model version 1.54.3 and Enhanced Current Population Survey data, we estimate that Harris’ Child Tax Credit expansion would cost [$117.4 billion](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=63712&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us) in 2025, assuming no behavioral responses. We project that the baby bonus contributes [$6.4 billion](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=63710&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us) to its cost.

The reform would [benefit 44% of Americans](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.winnersAndLosers.incomeDecile&reform=63712&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us), including 26% who would gain at least 5% of their net income. Those in the eighth income decile are most likely to benefit, while those in the fourth decile are most likely to gain at least 5%.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*MOotvlk1g6GWT9sF)

Assuming full take-up, the proposal would reduce the Supplemental Poverty Measure 9.1% overall, with disproportionate impact for children (30.5%), Black and Hispanic Americans (10.6% and 11.4%), and women (9.7%). It would also reduce deep poverty 9.9%, including 36.3% among children. Finally, Harris’ CTC would reduce [income inequality](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=63712&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us) by between 0.6% (top 1% share) and 1.4% (Gini index), depending on the measure.


### Labor Supply Effects

Incorporating labor supply responses based on Congressional Budget Office elasticities modifies these projections:

- Hours worked would fall by 0.25%
- Earnings would fall by 0.14%
- The total federal cost would increase 4.8% to $122.9 billion (state and local income tax revenue would also fall $0.9 billion)
- The child poverty impact would fall 6% (1.7pp) to 28.8%

About one-third of these changes reflect the “income effect” (people working less because they have more money), while two-thirds reflect “substitution effects” (changes in work incentives due to altered marginal tax rates).


### Conclusion

Based on the PolicyEngine model analysis, the proposed Child Tax Credit expansion by Kamala Harris is projected to cost $117.4 billion while reducing child poverty 31% without assuming behavioral responses, which would raise the cost 5% and lower the child poverty impact 6%. These projections are based on current economic conditions and assume full implementation and take-up of the proposed policy. Actual outcomes may vary based on economic fluctuations, implementation details, and other policy interactions.

We invite you to use our tools to explore the reform in more detail at the [US-wide level](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=63712&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us), to view how it affects your own state (for example, [here’s California](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=63712&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=ca)), and to see how it would affect [your own household](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=63712&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025).

## Analysis of JD vance’s $5,000 child tax credit proposal

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/analysis-of-jd-vances-5000-child-tax-credit-propos/
**Published:** 2024-08-12
**Description:** ### Analysis of JD Vance’s $5,000 Child Tax Credit Proposal

### Analysis of JD Vance’s $5,000 Child Tax Credit Proposal


#### Impacts of the Vice Presidential candidate’s reform depend largely on its uncertain refundability.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*INJFpBg6Zb-U1ddJr9wLfA.jpeg)

Senator and vice presidential nominee JD Vance (R-OH) has proposed expanding the Child Tax Credit (CTC) to $5,000 per child. His statements suggest he’d also like to remove income limits, while leaving the question of refundability uncertain. Using PolicyEngine, we’ve analyzed two versions of this proposal: one maintaining current refundability rules and another making the credit fully refundable.

The version maintaining current refundability would cost $106 billion in 2025 and reduce child poverty by 1%, assuming no behavioral responses. The fully refundable version would cost $241 billion and reduce child poverty by 41%. Applying labor supply assumptions from the Congressional Budget Office lowers the cost of the partially refundable by 8%, while increasing the cost of the fully refundable version by 2%. Both versions would increase disposable income across all income deciles and reduce income inequality.


### Vance’s Statements

In a 2021 [interview](https://abcnews.go.com/US/vance-argued-higher-tax-rate-childless-americans-2021/story?id=112284318) with Charlie Kirk, Vance expressed support for a tax policy favoring families with children:


> If you are making $100,000, $400,000 a year and you’ve got three kids, you should pay a different, lower tax rate than if you are making the same amount of money and you don’t have any kids.

Vance spoke about this with Margaret Brennan of Face the Nation in an [interview](https://youtu.be/pK1V2q05Zi8?si=tyJuJ37hV7jPuaZQ) that aired today, including the CTC as an instantiation of his 2021 suggestion. He then proposed expanding it:


> I’d love to see a child tax credit that’s $5,000 per child.

When asked about income limits, Vance added:


> I’d like to have a broad-based family policy and a broad-based child tax credit. […] I think you want it to apply to all families. I don’t think that you want this massive cutoff for lower income families, which you have today, you don’t want a different policy for higher income families, you just want to have a pro-family child tax credit.


### Background on the Child Tax Credit

The current CTC provides up to $2,000 per child, with a partial refundability structure, as our [CTC explainer](https://policyengine.org/us/research/the-child-tax-credit-in-2023) details. Low-income parents who don’t benefit from the $2,000 non-refundable credit can receive the Additional Child Tax Credit, a refundable credit that phases in with earnings above $2,500. The credit then begins to phase out at incomes of $200,000 for single filers and $400,000 for joint filers. PolicyEngine projects that this phase-out structure will reduce the program’s cost by [$5 billion in 2025](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=63060&focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2), or [$4 billion](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.policyBreakdown&reform=63085&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us) accounting for behavioral responses.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*pEOu1VXlahfSP2g8)

The most recent attempt to expand the CTC came in the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act (TRAFWA). The House [passed](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7024/all-actions) this bill 357–70 in January. However, on August 1, the Senate fell short of the votes needed to pass it, with a 48–44 vote; Vance was absent for this vote. We [analyzed](https://policyengine.org/us/research/trafwa-ctc) the potential impacts of TRAFWA in March.


### Household Impacts

Vance’s proposal would provide up to $5,000 per child, though specific amounts vary with marital status, income, number of children, and the policy’s refundability.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*LozrS5KgfAaq8bVS)

Regardless of refundability, parents with income above certain levels would gain $5,000 per child; for example, a married family with . For low-income parents, the fully refundable version could provide up to $5,000 per child in additional benefits. Otherwise, both versions provide an additional $3,000 per child for most families currently receiving the full $2,000 credit, except those in the phase-in region of the partially-refundable version.

For personalized calculations, you can use our calculators for the version with [current refundability](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=63077&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us) and [full refundability](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=63076&baseline=2&timePeriod=2025&region=enhanced_us).


### Societal Impacts

Applying the PolicyEngine US 1.45.2 microsimulation model and Enhanced CPS data, we project that the CTC expansion would cost $106 billion and $241 billion in 2025 if maintaining or expanding refundability, respectively, while reducing poverty and inequality. The Table 1 summarizes these impacts:


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NvShFid1ZLqkw4hMBiFPDQ.png)

Maintaining current refundability, one in three Americans would benefit from the reform, and one in five would gain at least 5% of their net income. Less than five percent of people in the bottom two deciles would benefit, however, as most do not have income tax for the non-refundable credit to offset.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*r9Vpz-45q2jOvtCP)

Making the credit fully refundable increases the share of Americans who would benefit by 40%, from 33% to 47%. Two in five would also benefit by at least 5% of their net income. All who gain in the bottom seven income deciles would benefit by at least 5%, including 22% in the bottom two deciles (they are less likely to benefit because of lower-income households having fewer children).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*mn0O2wftzVoEa7-W)


### Labor supply responses

The incorporation of labor supply responses based on CBO elasticities reveals differing impacts between the non-refundable and fully refundable versions of the expanded Child Tax Credit. These elasticities capture two mechanisms by which people might work less: they have more money and can purchase leisure (“income effect”) and they take home less for a marginal hour of work (“substitution effect”).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tdNLYqUhv6yEzuK6u3YEJA.png)

Without changing refundability, income effects reduce labor supply, but substitution effects from removing the additional 5 percentage point marginal tax rate in the CTC phase-out region dominate, resulting in a net increase in labor supply.

With full refundability, income effects lower labor supply, and substitution effects operate in both directions: lower marginal tax rates from removing the phase-out, but higher marginal tax rates from removing the phase-in. The net effect is lower labor supply from both income and substitution effects, with income effects having a larger impact.


### Conclusion

JD Vance’s proposal to expand the Child Tax Credit to $5,000 per child and remove income limits would significantly alter current family tax policy. The impacts vary substantially based on refundability: the fully refundable version would cost 2 to 2.5x as much as the partially refundable version, but would reduce child poverty by 41% compared to 1%.

Both versions would increase disposable income for most families with children and reduce income inequality, with the refundable version providing more substantial benefits to lower-income households.

Labor supply effects differ as well, with the partially refundable version slightly increasing work hours and the fully refundable version slightly decreasing them.

Key areas of uncertainty in this analysis include:

- Take-up rates, especially for the fully refundable version
- Extent of labor supply responses
- Macroeconomic feedback effects beyond labor supply responses, such as deficit impacts

As policymakers consider this and other proposals, tools like PolicyEngine can provide valuable insights into the potential impacts on different households and the overall economy. However, these projections should be considered alongside other evidence and potential long-term consequences to form a comprehensive understanding of the policy’s effects.

## Individual income tax provisions of president biden’s 2025 budget

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/individual-income-tax-provisions-of-president-bide/
**Published:** 2024-03-28
**Description:** ### Individual income tax provisions of President Biden’s 2025 Budget

### Individual income tax provisions of President Biden’s 2025 Budget


#### PolicyEngine projects the impact of expanding tax credits and raising taxes on high-income filers.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*0tsAtlzm7VL56BhT.JPG)

President Biden introduced his [2025 Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/11/fact-sheet-the-presidents-budget-for-fiscal-year-2025/) earlier this month, proposing a mix of reforms to both revenues and outlays. This report applies the PolicyEngine US microsimulation model to analyze four of its main individual income tax reforms:

- Restoring the 2021 Child Tax Credit expansion
- Restoring the 2021 Earned Income Tax Credit expansion for filers without qualifying children
- Raising the top marginal tax rate to 39.6%
- Increasing the Medicare and Net Investment Income taxes

We estimate that, in 2024 and assuming no behavioral responses, these reforms would cost $40.5 billion, lower poverty 12%, and lower income inequality. 59% of Americans would see a higher net income, while 3% would see a lower net income. This report describes these impacts in more detail, and examines effects on individual households.

[See how President Biden’s 2025 Budget affects your household with our personalized calculator.](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=50893&focus=intro&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2)


### The reforms

Here we summarize the four provisions of Biden’s 2025 Budget that PolicyEngine models, based on the [Department of the Treasury’s details](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/General-Explanations-FY2025.pdf).


### Restoring the 2021 Child Tax Credit expansion

Biden’s budget restores the expansion to the Child Tax Credit (CTC) enacted in the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). It would make the CTC fully refundable beginning in 2024, and for 2024 and 2025 increase the age limit from 16 to 17. Additionally, it increases the maximum credit per child to $3,600 for children under 6, and $3,000 for older children, phasing out at 5% of income in excess of a threshold dependent on filing status: $150,000 (married joint), $112,500 (head of household), and $75,000 (other). These amounts are not inflation-adjusted.

For example, this reform would provide an additional $3,600 to a single parent of two children, with one below six, if their income is below $6,600. The net benefit would phase out until their earnings reach $164,000, as shown [here](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&household=43046).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*b4iPi1yq5BgsTHux)

To learn more, read our** **[2023 report on restoring the ARPA CTC.](https://policyengine.org/us/research/restoration-of-the-american-rescue-plan-acts-expanded-child-tax-credit)


### Restoring the 2021 Earned Income Tax Credit expansion for filers without qualifying children

Biden similarly proposed restoring ARPA’s expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for filers without qualifying children. His plan would:

- Increase the phase-in and phase-out rates from 7.65% to 15.3%
- Lower the minimum age from 25 to 19 (or 24 for students)
- Remove the maximum age, currently 65
- Raise the maximum credit from $632 to $1,749 (adjusted for inflation from 2021)

This would change the EITC [as follows](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=50974&focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&household=40437) for a single person between 25 and 65:


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*O92F233Vaga2cfI8)

Producing a net benefit of up to $1,360 at $13,500 earnings, phasing out until earnings reach $25,000.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*8yOkbR3oWf6mNbRM)

To learn more, read our [2023 report on restoring the ARPA EITC.](https://policyengine.org/us/research/restoring-arpa-eitc)


### Increasing the top marginal rate to 39.6%

The President proposed raising the top marginal tax rate from 37% to 39.6%, its value prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The new rate would apply to income above $400,000 for single filers, $425,000 for head of household filers, $450,000 for married filers, and $225,000 for married separate filers. The reform would take effect in 2024, and the thresholds would rise with inflation starting in 2025.

For a [single person](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=50882&focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&household=43050) without itemized deductions, taxes would begin rising at $414,600 ($400,000 plus the standard deduction), and reach $19,400 in additional taxes at $1 million earnings.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*B4zBerNqDKQtXONc)


### Increasing the Medicare and Net Investment Income taxes

Finally, the President proposed increasing both the top Medicare tax rate and top Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) rate by 1.2 percentage points for individuals with income over $ 400,000. Since this is based on wages or net investment income, it kicks in at $400,000, not the higher amount resulting from the standard deduction. For an [individual](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=50660&focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&household=43051) with $1 million in wages, it would increase their taxes by $7,200.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*EG5QzaVzXMfuxZ3c)


### Provisions not modeled

The Budget introduces three additional individual income tax reforms that PolicyEngine does not yet model:

- Applying the NIIT to pass-through business income of taxpayers with income above $400,000
- Tax long-term capital gains and qualified dividends as ordinary income for filers with taxable income above $1 million
- Repeal “step-up basis” that increases the basis of inherited assets to the value at inheritance
- Impose a minimum tax of 25% on total income (including unrealized capital gains) for taxpayers with wealth exceeding $100 million

Additionally, it reforms some of the programs we model in additional ways, such as a monthly CTC advance, and introduces many reforms outside the individual income tax. As we enhance our model, we will be able to forecast impacts of these types of reforms.


### Combined household impacts

To see the combined impacts of all four reforms on net income and work incentives, we examine two household types: a single person and a married couple with two young children.


### Single person

The [single person](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=51189&focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&household=43051) would see a larger EITC at low incomes, then a tax increase when their wages exceed $400,000, reaching a $26,600 total impact at $1 million earnings.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*G3krZSBCHVu2Xbwf)

Their [marginal tax rate](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=51189&focus=householdOutput.mtr&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&household=43051) would fall up to 20pp in the earnings range where the EITC phases in further, then rise 15.3 percentage points as it phases out. It would then rise by 1.2pp from $400,000 to $414,600 (due to the additional Medicare rate, before the 39.6% rate kicks in), 5.8pp until earnings reach $623,950 (before they reach the current top marginal rate), and stabilize at a 3.8pp rise. The total marginal rate on top earnings would reach 43.2%.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*YxlpJfHqW5R3BIEp)


### Family of four

A [married couple with two children](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=51189&focus=householdOutput.earnings&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&household=43059) under six will gain up to $7,200 from the expanded CTC, until their earnings reach $220,000 (assuming only one earner). Their taxes will then rise beginning at $400,000 earnings, and by $1 million earnings their taxes would rise by $27,500.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*0IBvj5oF5Jv_cAva)

The reform increases their [marginal tax rate](https://policyengine.org/us/household?reform=51189&focus=householdOutput.mtr&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2&household=43059), due to making the CTC fully refundable (removing the phase-in that reduces marginal tax rates), phasing out the additional CTC benefit for higher earners, and the high-income tax increases. The marginal tax rate increase stabilizes at 3.8pp for earnings above $770,000.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*vzdISr5GI4VcDmjY)


### Nationwide results

We run the PolicyEngine tax-benefit microsimulation model, using our [Enhanced Current Population Survey](https://policyengine.org/us/research/enhanced-cps-beta) and assuming no behavioral responses, to project budgetary and distributional impacts.

These provisions together would cost [$41 billion in 2024](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.netIncome&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) and [$35 billion in 2025](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.netIncome&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2), according to the PolicyEngine model. While all provisions grow in magnitude, the tax increases grow faster, resulting in a smaller net impact. See Appendix A for a breakdown by provision and comparison to Treasury’s projections.

The net income of the bottom nine deciles would [rise](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2), on average, while the top decile’s would fall.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*U8PVwgIOPwao0B3a)

As a [percentage](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) of net income, the impact falls monotonically with income decile:


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*FYfP1qgE6EF0ojl4)

Three in five Americans would see an [increase](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) in net income, while three percent–almost entirely in the top income decile–would see it fall.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*zUezlVy2vxvAqKqt)

The Supplemental Poverty Measure would fall 12%, disproportionately among [children](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) (31%), [women](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.genderPovertyImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) (13%), and [Blacks and Hispanics](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.racialPovertyImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) (14–15%).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fPcXYZPC77uYeIZj)

[Deep poverty](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) falls at a similar rate, while [income inequality](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=51189&focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) falls 1.7% to 2.7%, depending on the measure.


### Conclusion

President Biden’s proposed individual income tax reforms in his 2025 Budget, as analyzed by PolicyEngine, would have notable impacts on American households and the economy. The restoration of the expanded Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit from the American Rescue Plan Act, along with the proposed increases in the top marginal tax rate, Medicare tax, and Net Investment Income Tax, are projected to result in a net cost of approximately $41 billion in 2024 and $35 billion in 2025.

The analysis suggests that the reforms would have a progressive impact on income distribution, with the bottom nine deciles experiencing an average increase in net income, while the top decile would see a decrease. The proposed changes are also projected to reduce the Supplemental Poverty Measure by 12%, with varying impacts across demographic groups. Income inequality would also be affected, with reductions ranging from 1.7% to 2.7%, depending on the measure used.

This analysis does not account for potential behavioral responses to the proposed tax changes, and differs from Treasury’s budgetary estimates for reasons described below (Treasury does not provide distributional estimates). As policymakers and the public consider these reforms, it will be crucial to carefully examine the potential impacts and trade-offs associated with the proposed changes to the individual income tax system.


### Appendix A: Budgetary breakdown

This table compares PolicyEngine’s estimates in 2024 and 2025 to those of the Treasury Department.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cOgMrPWFRtnFILJ4-yg_yw.png)

Due to timing considerations — we place the budgetary impact of tax credits in the tax year, while Treasury does so only when paid in advance, mirroring the delivery of most payments in the following year — the combined impact across years provides more comparable numbers than either year in isolation. Here, Treasury estimates $94.4 billion from 2024–25, while PolicyEngine estimates $75.2 billion. This does not fully account for timing considerations, since Treasury allocates part of our 2025 estimates to 2026.

Other deviations could result from multiple causes. For example, we do not model the provision to apply the NIIT to pass-through business income of high-income filers, which occurs prior to the NIIT increase; accounting for this would thus increase our estimate of that provision. Further calibration of our [microdata](https://policyengine.org/us/research/enhanced-cps-beta) to existing costs of programs could also better align these estimates; for example, [to the EITC](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/issues/4276).

## Child tax credit provisions of the tax relief for american workers and families act

#### How the Wyden-Smith bipartisan tax package would affect families through 2025.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*-Mw3_pKFvdwWLGId)

When Politico [reported](https://twitter.com/ben_guggenheim/status/1745403401695908256) the bipartisan tax package on January 11, we provided the [first budgetary and distributional analysis](https://policyengine.org/us/research/wyden-smith-ctc) of its main Child Tax Credit (CTC) provisions, that day. Today, we’re expanding that analysis to reflect all CTC provisions in the [Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024](https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/the_tax_relief_for_american_families_and_workers_act_of_2024_technical_summary.pdf) (TRAFWA), which Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-OR) and House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-MO) [announced on January 16](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/smith-wyden-announce-agreement-on-tax-framework-to-help-families-and-main-street-businesses/). The House [passed the bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7024/all-actions) 357–70 on January 31, and it currently sits in the Senate.

From 2023 to 2025 — in our static model assuming full take-up — we project the TRAFWA’s CTC reforms would:

- Cost $40 billion
- Lower child poverty by 4.7% in 2023, rising to 9.5% in 2025
- Benefit 9% of the population in 2023, and about 40% in 2024–25
- Lower the Gini index of income inequality by 0.1% in 2023, rising to 0.3% in 2025

This report describes these results in more detail, both for individual households and society at large. We’ll show the [custom mini-app](https://policyengine.org/us/trafwa-ctc-calculator) we built to capture the multi-year effects of the bill on your own family. This is also the first analysis we’ve published using our Enhanced Current Population Survey, we’ve built to give everyone access to the most accurate tax-benefit microsimulation modeling available — learn more about our launch of this cutting-edge dataset here. We close with a comparison to the Joint Committee on Taxation’s results.

### How the Tax Relief for American Workers and Families Act of 2024 Would Reform the Child Tax Credit

The United States provides the Child Tax Credit (CTC) in two parts: the nonrefundable CTC and the refundable Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) established the ACTC at $1,400 and set the core CTC at $2,000 per child. While the TCJA did not index the core CTC to inflation, it did index the ACTC, resulting in its rise to $1,600 by 2023 and $1,700 in 2024. The ACTC phases in at 15 cents per dollar of earnings in excess of $2,500.

The TRAFWA makes four changes to the CTC:

- Raising the ACTC, starting in 2023: The maximum ACTC would rise from $1,600 to $1,800 in 2023, from $1,700 to $1,900 in 2024, and from $1,700 to the value of the full CTC in 2025. If inflation follows the Congressional Budget Office’s projections, the ACTC will rise to $2,100 in 2025 (see provision 4 below).
- Phasing in the ACTC with the number of children, starting in 2023: The ACTC would phase in at 15 cents multiplied by the number of CTC-eligible children, for each dollar of earnings above $2,500.
- Calculating the ACTC from the greater of earnings in the current and prior year, starting in 2024: Filers who earn more in 2023 than 2024 will be eligible for the ACTC based on 2023 earnings, and similarly for those who earn more in 2024 than 2025.
- Inflation-indexing the CTC, rounded down to the nearest $100, starting in 2024: This will increase the CTC to $2,100 in 2024, and unless inflation significantly outpaces CBO projections, it will remain at $2,100 in 2025.


### Impact on a Household

In our [previous report](https://policyengine.org/us/research/wyden-smith-ctc), we showed how the TRAFWA would affect a single parent of two in 2023. That analysis still holds, so here we’ll show a more complex example: a married family with three children, in 2025, with $10,000 of earnings in 2024. This household would be affected by all TRAWFA CTC reforms: the refundability rise, phase-in rate, inflation adjustment, and lookback provision.

Before getting into the analytics, let’s plug this household into our [new TRAFWA calculator](https://policyengine.org/us/trafwa-ctc-calculator). This tool lets you plug in a few pieces of information to see how the bill would affect you (we don’t collect any personally identifiable information). Let’s suppose they earned $30,000 in 2023, $10,000 in 2024, and $0 in 2025.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*-TiVkn4xxhEmM812)

After clicking **Calculate**, we can see that they gain $9,225 total. $7,950 of that comes in 2024 and 2025, largely due to the lookback provision, though they also gain from other provisions in each year.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*iirHzRPbLja-E4Yk)

Now let’s return to the main app for deeper analytics. [If this family has no earned income in 2025](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=44823&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=40256), they would be ineligible for any credit under current law. However, TRAFWA would make them eligible for an ACTC phasing in at 45% (15% times three children) of earnings in excess of $2,500, based on their $10,000 of 2024 earnings, up to a maximum of $6,300 ($2,100 for each of three children). That’s 45% of $7,500, or $3,375, which is below the cap.

TRAFWA would affect this family differently [depending on their earnings in 2025](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=44823&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=40256). Under current law (gray), their ACTC phases in beginning at $2,500, up to a maximum of $5,100 when their earnings reach $36,500. Under TRAFWA, they receive $3,375 until their 2025 earnings exceed their 2024 earnings, at which point it phases in at 45% before reaching $6,300. The non-refundable CTC then displaces the ACTC at higher earnings in both scenarios.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fkV9Z2PdXtG6FUxI)

The [net effect](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=44823&region=us&timePeriod=2025&baseline=2&household=40256) is a gain of up to $4,200 at $16,500 earnings, stabilizing at $300 from the inflation adjustment only at $38,500 earnings.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1-gBRdTFzk20GBj1)


### Societal Impact

We project that the TRAFWA CTC would cost $39.8 billion over the three years, with the cost rising each year. Appendix A compares the cost by year and provision to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Here we otherwise focus on 2024 impacts; to see other years, you can click the links and change the year in the right menu.

In 2024, households in the third income decile benefit most on an [absolute](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) basis, while those in the second decile benefit most on a [relative](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=46315&focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) basis. They benefit more than lower income households who have fewer children and don’t meet the earnings requirement, and more than higher income households who take the non-refundable CTC instead.

These provisions would [benefit 40% of US residents](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=46315&focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) in 2024. 4% of Americans gain at least 5% of net income, disproportionately those in the bottom four deciles.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fCLAKxRJJbob4GOV)

The number of people with resources below the poverty line would fall 2.0%, disproportionately [children](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=46315&focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) (6.9%), [Blacks](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=46315&focus=policyOutput.racialPovertyImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) (3.6%), and [women](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=46315&focus=policyOutput.genderPovertyImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2) (2.2%). We project that the bill would reduce the [number of children in poverty](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CApzPOg-qXbvYPdwmp0gIPK__kffixQH?authuser=1#scrollTo=OqtYayw8YNhu) by 345,000 in 2023, 573,000 in 2024, and 740,000 in 2025. Deep child poverty would [fall 6.1%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=46315&focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&region=enhanced_us&timePeriod=2024&baseline=2), and the Gini index of income inequality would [fall 0.25%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).


### Conclusion

As the Senate considers the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act, we present a new analysis into the budgetary, household, and distributional impacts it would generate. We do so using a new calculator, and a new dataset tuned for accurate policy forecasting, which we will continue to develop for greater accuracy in the future. Like all forecasts, ours carry uncertainty; for instance, our assumptions around full take-up and zero behavioral responses may not fully reflect reality, and future model enhancements will provide more flexible assumptions on these points.

To stay informed on our computational modeling of TRAFWA as it proceeds, analysis of new policies, and novel software to understand policy impacts, subscribe for our latest updates.


### Appendix A: Comparison to the Joint Committee on Taxation

The Joint Committee on Taxation expanded upon their official score in [this letter](https://chrissmith.house.gov/uploadedfiles/118-0673.pdf), which includes methodology and a provision-by-provision budgetary breakdown (they did not provide distributional impacts). They estimate the CTC provision cost $33.6 billion over the three years, while we estimate $39.8 billion, 18% higher.

As shown in the table below, major differences include:

- PolicyEngine assumes the $2,000 CTC rises to $2,100 in 2024; JCT assumes 2025. This is based on PolicyEngine’s research into the law and C-CPI-U values, and aligns with the Tax Foundation’s interpretation.
- PolicyEngine finds a substantially larger impact of the lookback provision. We build a panel from the 2018 and 2019 ASEC files, limiting to those who responded to employment and self-employment income questions, then build a quantile regression forests model to predict the distribution of prior-year earnings for each person in the CPS. This prediction algorithm adjusts the sampling distribution to match the total employment and self-employment income in the relevant year. Our model uses these variables as predictors.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_s1Oa25CCSX56n9A_eU-Sg.png)

Our estimates may also differ due to different data, take-up assumptions (we assume full take-up, including of the lookback provision), and behavioral responses (though JCT said that they project minimal labor supply effects).

To contextualize the higher estimate of the lookback provision, we used the constructed 2018–19 ASEC panel to compare the ACTC amounts between 2018 and 2019 for the same filers. [We found](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NSYogO-uKBeSA7ECz0vDDURVX8LvJrso?usp=sharing) that the greater of 2018 and 2019 ACTC sums to 34% above the 2019 ACTC for filers in the panel (and with reported rather than imputed employment and self-employment incomes). Applying this to the total 2019 ACTC, this suggests that filers would have received an additional $8.3 billion in ACTC payments if they could choose the greater of their 2018 and 2019 payment, though this would have been partly offset by lower non-refundable CTC payments.

## Wyden-smith child tax credit expansion

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/wyden-smith-child-tax-credit-expansion/
**Published:** 2024-01-11
**Description:** ### Wyden-Smith Child Tax Credit Expansion

### Wyden-Smith Child Tax Credit Expansion


#### PolicyEngine estimates the impact of the Democratic senators’ reported plan to expand the Child Tax Credit’s refundable component.


![Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*AtXQ49k-uYjbY-yy.jpg)

Politico’s Benjamin Guggenheim [reported today](https://twitter.com/ben_guggenheim/status/1745403401695908256) that senators Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Tina Smith (D-MN) are proposing a multifaceted reform to the Child Tax Credit (CTC). This report analyzes two of the three provisions of that reform: raising the maximum refundable CTC amount, and phasing in the refundable CTC with respect to the number of children. We illustrate how this affects a sample household and estimate its impact on society.

From 2023–25 — in our static model assuming full take-up — we project these provisions would:

- Cost $16.4 billion, owing mostly to the more rapid phase-in rate
- Lower poverty by about 1% and child poverty by about 4%
- Benefit 6% of the population
- Lower the Gini index of income inequality by 0.2%

[Click here to see how the Wyden-Smith proposal would affect your own household’s 2023 taxes.](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)


### How Wyden-Smith Would Reform the Child Tax Credit

The Child Tax Credit (CTC) in the United States consists of two parts: the nonrefundable Child Tax Credit and the refundable Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) established the ACTC at $1,400 and the core CTC at $2,000 per child. The ACTC is indexed to inflation, which led to its increase to $1,600 by 2023 and $1,700 in 2024. The refundable portion of the CTC (ACTC) is available to families with earnings, phasing in at a rate of 15% of earnings above a certain threshold.

Guggenheim reported that the Wyden-Smith reform includes three parts:

- Raising the refundable CTC amount: The maximum ACTC would rise from $1,600 to $1,800 in 2023, from $1,700 to $1,900 in 2024, and from $1,700 to the full $2,000 in 2025, with the amount indexed to inflation thereafter.
- Phasing in the refundable CTC with the number of children: Rather than a flat 15% phase-in rate, the CTC would phase in at 15% times the number of qualifying children.
- Allowing prior years’ income to count toward the CTC calculation: Guggenheim did not provide further detail on this provision, nor is PolicyEngine currently equipped to model it, given we use cross-sectional survey and tax data for our projections.

As the TCJA is set to expire after 2025, including its CTC expansion provisions, it is unclear what this proposal would do beyond 2025, so we constrain our analysis to 2023–2025, and focus on 2023 for illustrative examples.


### Impact on a Household

Shortly after Guggenheim reported the reform, Sharon Parrott, President of the [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://www.cbpp.org/), [tweeted an example](https://twitter.com/ParrottCBPP/status/1745497766137053289): “A mom w/ 2 kids who earns $15k wld get a $3600 #CTC in ’23, up from $1,875 under current law.” PolicyEngine reproduces that example, showing they [gain $1,725](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=39725). Rather than being partly phased in to the $3,200 ACTC ($1,600 for each of two children), the faster phase-in (30% instead of 15%) brings them all the way up to the $3,600 ACTC.

**Figure 1: Refundable Child Tax Credit with respect to earnings for a single parent of two children, under current law and the Wyden-Smith reform proposal.**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*bV6_hQkfJ4Oq4TMK)

This earnings level is where nearly the peak benefit occurs for this family: if they earned $14,500, they would gain a full $1,800. They will benefit if their earnings range from $2,500 to $29,000.

**Figure 2: Impact of Wyden-Smith Child Tax Credit reform proposal on the net income of a single parent of two children.**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*bO4aeUdIBSTe9cGQ)

The reform would lower the household’s marginal tax rate by 15 percentage points where the ACTC phases in faster, then raise it by 15 percentage points where it stabilizes instead of previously continuing to phase in, then raise it by 10 percentage points where it begins to interact with the non-refundable CTC.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*j1z2Wmv_ShPm_jVN)


### Societal Impact

Applying our static tax-benefit microsimulation model over the 2022 Current Population Survey, we estimate that these two provisions would cost $5.1 billion in 2023, $5.5 billion in 2024, and $5.9 billion in 2024, for a total three-year cost of $16.4 billion.

Breaking this down between the provisions reveals that they amplify each other: summed separately, they total $4.1 billion, but together they cost $5.1 billion, since the faster phase-in rate goes further when the maximum is higher.

**Table 1: Cost of Wyden-Smith Child Tax Credit reform by provision and year.**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1X9iN18E4d2D11aSSN6NBQ.png)

Households in the third income decile benefit most on both an [absolute](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) and [relative](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) basis. They benefit more than lower income households who have fewer children and don’t meet the earnings requirement, and more than higher income households who take the non-refundable CTC instead.

**Figure 4: Impact of Wyden-Smith Child Tax Credit reform proposal by income decile.**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ZO7CVih4HQQ6BiN4)

These provisions [benefit 6.4% of US residents](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2): 2.3% who gain at least 5% of net income, and 4.1% who gain less. Again, the prevalence of gains concentrates in the third income decile.

**Figure 5: Population share gaining from Wyden-Smith Child Tax Credit reform proposal by income decile.**


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*buBusyS9y4OmYCjA)

The number of people with resources below the poverty line would fall 1.3%, disproportionately [children](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) (4.3%), [Hispanics](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.racialPovertyImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) (2.4%), and [men](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.genderPovertyImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) (1.5%). The number of children in deep poverty would also [fall 0.7%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), and the Gini index of income inequality would [fall 0.2%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).

Results are similar in 2024 and 2025, with child poverty falling by 3.8% or 3.9%, rather than 4.3%.


### Conclusion

Senators Wyden and Smith have proposed a three-part expansion to the Child Tax Credit, of which PolicyEngine can currently model two. Firstly, it raises the maximum refundable ACTC amount incrementally from 2023 to 2025; secondly, it modifies the phase-in rate of the refundable CTC to be a function of the number of qualifying children; and thirdly, it includes a provision to allow the CTC calculation to be based on prior years’ income, a feature not currently supported.

The estimated impacts of the first two provisions on households include adjustments in the Child Tax Credit received at various income levels; for instance, a single parent of two would benefit if their earnings range from $2,500 to $29,000. These changes also influence marginal tax rates due to the modified phase-in rate of the ACTC.

From 2023 to 2025, the first two provisions would cost $16.4 billion, cut child poverty about 4%, benefit about 6% of Americans, and reduce deep poverty and income inequality. These impacts are relatively stable across the three years, and we do not project further due to the expiration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act after 2025.

As negotiations proceed, we will continue to develop our software platform to support a range of Child Tax Credit analyses, including those like the third provision to base the credit on prior years’ income (which also require further definition). Stay tuned and [check out our personalized calculator](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=44066&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) to see how the reform would affect you.

## Scott winship’s individualized earned income tax credit proposal

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/scott-winships-individualized-earned-income-tax-cr/
**Published:** 2023-07-14
**Description:** ### Scott Winship’s individualized Earned Income Tax Credit proposal

### Scott Winship’s individualized Earned Income Tax Credit proposal


#### An analysis and note on the value of open-source models.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qwkZz_5RZ5k3NF17iCQMhQ.jpeg)

On Monday, Scott Winship, senior fellow and the director of the Center on Opportunity and Social Mobility at the American Enterprise Institute, published [“Reforming the EITC to Reduce Single Parenthood and Ease Work-Family Balance”](https://ifstudies.org/blog/reforming-the-eitc-to-reduce-single-parenthood-and-ease-work-family-balance) for the Institute for Family Studies. The blog proposed a set of reforms to the Earned Income Tax Credit, most notably basing eligibility on individual rather than joint earnings for married earners. It would also limit EITC eligibility to filers with combined income below $100,000. This report reviews the individual, budgetary, and distributional impacts of that reform using PolicyEngine.

[See how an individualized EITC would affect you.](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=17331&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)


### EITC marriage incentives

The Earned Income Tax Credit is a refundable tax credit based, as all other federal income tax programs are, on a filer’s total income, including the combined income of spouses for joint filers. The credit increases with the number of children (up to three), phases in with respect to total earned income, and phases out with respect to adjusted gross income.

The structure of the EITC can create a marriage penalty for some people. A marriage penalty occurs when a couple’s total tax bill as a result of getting married exceeds what it would be if they were single and filing individually. As Winship notes:


> Consider an unmarried couple, in which one partner with two children makes $20,000 per year and the other (childless) partner makes $30,000 per year. Under current policy, while they remain unmarried, the parent gets a $6,604 EITC benefit, so their combined income is $56,604. If they get married, their EITC drops to $1,991 because the couple’s income is relatively high and the benefit phases out. They are worse off by $4,613.

PolicyEngine confirms these results, and also provides total net income after taxes and benefits. Table 1 illustrates how this penalty would work for a couple in Texas.

**Table 1: EITC and net income for a sample household under current law**

The EITC therefore contributes about half of the total marriage penalty faced by this couple, with other tax and benefit provisions contributing the other half. If they marry, they will lose $9,460, or 15% of their net income if unmarried.


### Individualizing the EITC

Winship proposes basing the EITC on individual earnings to reduce these marriage penalties. Specifically, his proposal applies the same EITC structure to married individuals, based on their number of kids and treating them as married, but phasing it in and out with respect to individual earnings. He also limits the credit to filers with combined adjusted gross income below $100,000.

Returning to the previous household (if married), they would see their EITC rise by $10,816. As a result, they would now face a marriage bonus of $1,356 (2%), including a $6,210 marriage bonus from the EITC, most of which is offset by a marriage penalty from other tax and benefit programs.

**Table 2: EITC and net income for a sample household under Winship’s individualized EITC**

We can also examine the “shape” of the reform by [varying the head’s earnings](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=17331&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=32055), holding the spouse’s earnings constant at $20,000.

Under current law (gray), the head starts on the “plateau” of the EITC due to their spouse’s earnings. As they earn more, they get no additional EITC, and then it phases out. In the reform (blue), their spouse’s EITC is constant, and their own EITC stacks atop it until it fully phases around $59,000 earnings. When the head earns $80,000, they hit the $100,000 AGI cap, and both the head and spouse lose their EITC, creating a [cliff](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/how-would-reforms-affect-cliffs).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*0EhFGZyfMcDJ5bi5)

The difference between these lines indicates the net effect of the reform. For someone with two children whose spouse earns $20,000, the reform would provide the maximum benefit of $10,816 if they earn between $28,500 and $39,500.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*z_QMwgr6-SHd1oU5)


### Nationwide impacts

PolicyEngine’s microsimulation model estimates budgetary and distributional impacts of policy reforms. The model runs over the Current Population Survey and is static: it does not assume any behavioral effects with respect to labor supply, marriage, child development, fertility, economic growth, or other factors. The model finds that Winship’s reform would:

- Cost $38.2 billion in 2023
- Benefit 13% of the population
- Lower poverty by 0.7% and child poverty by 1.3%, disproportionately among Hispanic Americans
- Lower deep poverty by 0.4% and deep child poverty by 0.6%
- Lower the Gini index of income inequality by 0.7%
- Increase the share of households facing cliffs by 16%

[Households in the fifth income decile](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&reform=17331&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) would gain the largest share of their income, at 1.4%.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*dt4R1nm9QxO11v28)

[The reform would benefit 13% of Americans](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=17331&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), and 8% of Americans would see their net income rise at least 5% (dark green). Gains are most concentrated in the fifth income decile, 29% of whom would benefit.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*gSnAHg8M-S9Hxhv1)


### Differences from Winship’s initial (now revised) estimate

When Winship first released his blog post, he estimated that the reform would cost $155 billion from 2024 to 2033, citing his colleague Bodi Yang. Yang produced this estimate in a [notebook](https://github.com/bodiyang/EITC-reform/blob/cbd79625b2fad708b8dbfc8768bcc73135ec1007/eitc_reform.ipynb) that estimated a $13.2 billion cost in 2023, allowing for a direct comparison to PolicyEngine, which currently estimates impacts in 2023 only. After we successfully investigated the discrepancy between this figure and our higher one, he revised the post and [credited us](https://twitter.com/swinshi/status/1678746851330105345) for the research. We found the issue subtle and the case study instructive.

To produce this cost estimate, Winship ran the open source Tax-Calculator microsimulation model over the IRS Public Use File (PUF). As a sample of tax returns, analysts generally regard the PUF as a more accurate source of income data than the CPS — and we are currently [incorporating that information into our data](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis). However, the PUF lacks information on each spouse’s earnings, since filers only need to report the combined total on tax forms. To fill this gap, the Tax-Calculator project determines the average split of income between filer and spouse from the CPS, and applies that equally to PUF records.

PolicyEngine instead uses the CPS directly, where respondents report the income of each person separately. As a result, we capture the diversity of couples with respect to spousal earnings splits. Because this reform disproportionately affects those with large earnings differences between spouses, this difference is material. We believe our $38 billion estimate is more accurate, because it uses income splits directly from the Current Population Survey (CPS).

We shared our findings with Winship the day he released the report, and the next day he corrected it to use the Tax-Calculator CPS data, crediting our find. Winship now reports a $395 billion cost from 2024 to 2033, and Yang’s notebook shows a $43 billion cost in 2023.

This instance taught three lessons in our view:

- Open source models facilitate better policy analysis. We were only able to diagnose the discrepancy because the Tax-Calculator and Tax-Data code are publicly available on GitHub, as was AEI analyst Bodi Yang’s code that produced the estimates. Those who have identified opportunities to improve our own open source software have improved our policy analysis as well.
- The Current Population Survey outperforms the IRS Public Use File for some policy questions. We use the CPS to capture personal relationships within a household, benefit receipt, poverty, and other factors absent from the sample of tax returns in the IRS Public Use File. This comes at a cost: the CPS truncates income more than the PUF, has more measurement error, and lacks some characteristics like specific deductions. We will address those deficiencies by integrating the datasets later this year, but in the meantime, this analysis revealed a particular research question where the CPS can outperform the PUF.
- Stochastic imputations produce more realistic data. If Tax-Data applied a stochastic technique, such as quantile regression, it would have produced greater spread of the spousal earnings share, compared to the constant approach. When we integrate PUF information into the CPS, we will do so using the survey-enhance software package we developed to combine the accuracy of machine learning with the stochasticity of quantile regression (here’s our working paper).

Scott Winship’s EITC reform proposal would directionally achieve its goal of reducing marriage penalties — even shifting some into marriage bonuses — though we have yet to estimate the aggregate impact on marriage incentives. It would also cost about $40 billion in 2023, reduce poverty and inequality, and make cliffs more prevalent.

We’re grateful to Winship and Yang for their collaborative spirit in identifying and resolving a subtle data issue that resulted in significant deviations across datasets, and look forward to further collaborations with open source models to improve the quality and reproducibility of policy analysis.

## Analysis of “guaranteed income for the 21st century”

**Published:** 2023-06-08
**Description:** ### Analysis of “Guaranteed Income for the 21st Century”

### Analysis of “Guaranteed Income for the 21st Century”


#### The proposal from the New School and the Economic Security Project would lower poverty and inequality while expanding cliffs.


![Darrick Hamilton, an author of “Guaranteed Income for the 21st Century” at TED](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qpWIV3PKheh8Fsos72t5GQ.jpeg)

In May 2021, researchers at the [New School’s Institute on Race and Political Economy](https://www.newschool.edu/institute-race-power-political-economy/), with support from the [Economic Security Project](https://www.economicsecurityproject.org/), released a paper titled, [“Guaranteed Income for the 21st Century.”](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UDFPwUYu2Rf4RGgXuOTacmBj2Gt9paAV/view) The paper proposed a policy that expands the Earned Income Tax Credit by guaranteeing $12,500 per adult and $4,500 per child, phasing out for income above certain thresholds.

In this report, we depict the impact on a sample household, as well as on US-wide metrics like the budget, poverty, inequality, and cliffs. We also compare some estimates to the New School’s.

Overall, we find that the reform would, in 2023:

- Cost $1.26 trillion
- Benefit three in five Americans
- Cut poverty 94%
- Lower the Gini index of income inequality 19%
- Increase the prevalence and severity of cliffs by 466% and 100%, respectively

This report describes and compares the New School’s proposal and analysis; calculates the impact for a sample household; and goes into these US-wide results in greater depth.

### The Guaranteed Income for the 21st Century proposal

*Guaranteed Income for the 21st Century, *or *21GI* as the New School abbreviates it,* *would abolish the Earned Income Tax Credit and provide $12,500 per adult and $4,500 per child. The proposal then phases out the new benefit linearly with respect to the tax unit’s adjusted gross income, depending on number of adults: It would phase out from $10,000 to $50,000 for single-adult tax units, and from $15,000 to $70,000 for two-adult tax units. The below graphic, from 39:18 of the New School’s [video](https://vimeo.com/552064973), depicts the reform.

### Sample household

Consider a [single parent of one child in New York City](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=31338). As they earn more, the net benefit of the 21GI falls, due to the shape of the EITC (in this case, federal, state, and local EITCs, since NYS and NYC based their EITCs on the federal), and the phase-out of the new payment itself.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XTHawfysW_0cTtQTtO3V_w.jpeg)

This chart shows baseline (gray) and 21GI (blue) net income as the parent earns more. The shaded regions indicate “earnings dead zones”, where the household is worse off for earning due to cliffs. The doubly-shaded regions are earnings dead zones in the baseline and reform, while the more lightly shaded regions are only cliffs in the reform. Because 21GI adds more phase-out (marginal tax rates), it extends existing cliffs, which in this case result from SNAP and reduced price school meals.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MUWablXY0CIQ68sPpdlC-g.jpeg)

We can also visualize these cliff and incentive impacts in marginal tax rates. 21GI would raise marginal tax rates for all low-income households. For this household, it will raise it by up to 95 percentage points, at an earnings level where the new payment is phasing out, and the federal/state/local EITCs would all otherwise have phased in, lowering marginal tax rates.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zG4Qk5b3B492r3jUonrtZg.jpeg)

Similar to the net income chart above, we can see how 21GI affects total marginal tax rates. This household under 21GI would face marginal tax rates above 70% continuously for most of the earnings range from $13,500 to $49,000.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3OMiseQ87hvfdLXSxd718A.jpeg)


### US-wide impacts

Our static microsimulation model, which applies 2023 tax and benefit rules to the 2021 Current Population Survey March Supplement, finds the following results.


#### Budgetary impact

We project that 21GI would cost [$1.26 trillion](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), including the main benefit and the EITC elimination.

This estimate exceeds the New School’s estimate of $876 billion by 43%. This discrepancy could result from multiple factors, including importantly the source dataset and tax filing unit assumption.

While we apply the benefit and phase-out to tax units in the 2021 Current Population Survey, the New School applied it to households in the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances. To the extent that SCF households include multiple tax filing units, it would tend to underestimate the cost by phasing out the benefit for a household whose income would include multiple tax units.

As an example, suppose a 22-year-old, who earns $30,000, lives with their parent, who earns $100,000. 21GI would provide the parent nothing and the child $6,250, half the maximum benefit, given their earnings fall halfway within the $10,000–50,000 phase-out range. But the SCF would show the household as a single tax filing unit with $130,000 income, and thus disqualified from any 21GI benefit.

21GI would alter incentives to file separately; however, neither PolicyEngine nor New School model changing filing behavior as a result.


#### Impact by income decile

The reform would [add 11.7% to net incomes](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) overall, and this percentage decreases with income, from 110% at the bottom decile to 0.7% at the top.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oD2ReebhMv_OYA5zBWfiyA.jpeg)


#### Distributional impacts

21GI would [benefit 60% of the population](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), of whom 97% would gain at least 5% of net income. Over 99% of the bottom fifth would gain, as would 23% of those in the top decile (due to households that comprise multiple filing units).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*maqbky4pbH-RJX46kvBBnA.jpeg)


#### Poverty

Under 21GI, poverty would fall by [94% overall](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), and by at least 90% for most subgroups. [Deep poverty would also fall 99%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*whSNdoMuLeXE-bRmDGtilw.jpeg)


#### Inequality

21GI would lower income inequality, disproportionately for the broadest measure we report, the Gini index, which would fall 19%.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wvHl0ybCQYcgyOngym2YJA.jpeg)


#### Cliffs

Currently, PolicyEngine estimates that 0.6% of households face a cliff, by which an additional $2,000 of earnings per adult would make the household financially worse off. We expect that this underestimates the prevalence of cliffs, since we have not yet modeled all tax and benefit programs that would increase marginal tax rates or introduce explicit cliffs.

As a result of 21GI’s additional marginal tax rates, that rate of [cliffs would rise 466% to 3.3%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=1006&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) (one in 30 households). The total lost income from those facing cliffs would also double from $6 billion to $12 billion.

## Analysis of the DC financial support for families with children amendment act

### Analysis of the DC Financial Support for Families with Children Amendment Act


#### Evaluating Councilmember Zachary Parker’s second Child Tax Credit proposal of 2023.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*txA2UGNtxxZ8h5GAdVxQRA.png)

*We thank the *[Mother’s Outreach Network](https://mothersoutreachnetwork.org/)* for supporting this research. PolicyEngine conducts all research independently of our funders.*

[We recently examined the District Child Tax Credit (DCTC)](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/district-child-tax-credit), a proposed bill from DC Councilmember Zachary Parker. Today, we will examine another proposal from Councilmember Parker called the [Financial Support for Families with Children Amendment Act (FSFC)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/14865nw8firxgo2/CM%20Parker%20Basic%20Income%20Bill%203.21.23_FINAL.pdf?dl=0) and its potential economic impact on Washington, D.C. residents.


### The Financial Support for Families with Children Amendment Act

Beginning in the 2024 tax year, the FSFC would provide up to $1,000 per year to children eligible for the federal Child Tax Credit (those below age 17). It reduces the credit by $100 per $1,000 (10% marginal tax rate) of adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeding specific thresholds: $10,000, or $20,000 for joint filers.


### Example household

Consider a married household with two children, ages 10 and 16, and an adjusted gross income of $25,000. The FSFCA would make them eligible for a maximum credit of $2,000 ($1,000 per child). However, since their income exceeds the $20,000 threshold amount for joint filers by $5,000, the credit falls by $500 ($100 for each $1,000, or 10%). Therefore, the household will receive a final credit of $1,500.

For a joint filer with two children, the credit fully phases out if their income reaches $40,000 ($20,000 phase-out threshold + $2,000 credit / 10% phase-out rate = $20,000 + $20,000).

**To see how the FSFC would affect your own household, **[enter your information into our personalized calculator](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=8007&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)**.**

*Note that our calculator assumes that your household files taxes together, not married filing separately on the same return.*


### Scenario analysis

A filer’s FSFC depends on their marital status, number of children, and income, as illustrated in the following chart. Applying similar math to the previous section, the credit fully phases out for single filers with one child at $20,000 income, two children at $30,000, and three children at $40,000. For married joint filers, the credit fully phases out at $10,000 higher income: $30,000 for one child, $40,000 for two children, and $50,000 for three children.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*BCBH9b-nkhBgfGih)


### DC-wide impacts

We estimate DC-wide impacts by pairing our 2023 rules engine with the 2021 [Current Population Survey March Supplement](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-asec.html) (CPS), which contains 1,135 DC households. As we have not yet modeled DC income taxes, we also assume that filers apply the same filing status as on their federal return, rather than married couples filing separately on the same return, as DC allows.

PolicyEngine estimates that the FSFA would [cost about $27 million](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=8007&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) in 2023. This equates to [$84 per household](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=8007&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), or [0.1% of net income](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&reform=8007&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), disproportionately to households in the second income decile (households in the bottom income decile have fewer children). Overall, the policy would [reduce income inequality by 0.0–0.3%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=8007&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), depending on the metric.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Zv6RqNmcgMkrlHWa)

[The FSFC would benefit one in ten Washingtonians](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=8007&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), and one in twelve would see their net income rise by at least five percent.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Z3wEluteyWjEyx3R)

14.0% of Washingtonians have resources below their [Supplemental Poverty Measure](https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/supplemental-poverty-measure.html) threshold. We estimate that the FSFC would affect poverty rates [identically to the DCTC](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/district-child-tax-credit): lowering the rate 1.3% to 13.8%, child poverty by 5.2%, larger poverty reductions among men, and no deep poverty impact. In reality, the policies would have different effects, but given the small sample sizes, similar surveyed households fall near the poverty line and would be pushed above it by both the DCTC and FSFC.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*JkBfpEumAbVkTxpM)

According to our data, the FSFC’s poverty reduction would be [entirely felt by Black non-Hispanic Washingtonians](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.racialPovertyImpact&reform=8007&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), reducing their poverty rate from 22.9% to 22.5%.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*CDnH3pVVtjeVdm8o)

To contextualize our results in DC, which carry noise due to the small sample size, we can compare poverty impacts to the FSFC’s if it were enacted nationwide. Across the US, the FSFC would reduce deep poverty by 60% more than it reduces poverty, including 31% deep child poverty reductions. It would have similar poverty impacts by sex, but reduce deep poverty more among women. Its impact on Black and Hispanic poverty rates would be about double the impact on White non-Hispanic poverty rates.

**FSFC poverty reduction by population subset and geography**

### Comparing Financial Support for Families with Children to the District Child Tax Credit

Councilmember Parker proposed the FSFC on March 23, three weeks after proposing the DCTC. Councilmembers George, Allen, Pinto, and Robert White joined Parker by co-introducing both bills (Chair Mendelson and Councilmembers Henderson, Trayon White Sr., and Nadeau additionally co-introduced the DCTC). While the proposals share common features as tax credits for families with children, and PolicyEngine projects similar impacts, they also differ in important respects.

FSFC provides larger benefits to a lower-income population and phases out faster; however, the DCTC targets in some ways that FSFC does not, by enacting a child cap and residency requirement. FSFC would also take effect two years before the DCTC.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cLrx9sthXcVS5AsNduRdIA.png)

PolicyEngine estimates that FSFC has identical impacts to the DCTC on the budget and poverty rates, though [more comprehensive data](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-12-28-enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis) would likely identify differences. FSFC would reduce inequality about 50% more by targeting transfers to a population about half the size of the DCTC.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7mA6fraWhMVGC2I2c_-Srg.png)


### Context of other DC programs for low-income families

Like the DCTC, the FSFC would be available to families that don’t have to otherwise file taxes. To complement the background we provided in the DCTC report on TANF and the EITC, we provide some relevant statistics on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and the Homeowner and Renter Property Tax Credit.

The DC Department of Health and Human Services administers DC’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which targets similarly low-income families with children. The federal Department of Health and Human Services reports that [4,288 families](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ofa/fy2022_tanf_caseload.pdf) participated in DC’s TANF program in an average month in 2022.

DC residents can claim the Homeowner and Renter Property Tax Credit (HRPTC) on the [Schedule H](https://otr.cfo.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/otr/publication/attachments/2020_Schedule_H_0.pdf) tax form. Residents that pay rent or property tax can claim the HRPTC, unless they live in one of the District’s roughly [10,000 public housing units](https://www.dchousing.org/wordpress/about-us/dcha-by-the-numbers/), or exceed the income limits. Roughly [250,000 individuals](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=9008&region=dc&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) are in tax filing units with income below the $57,600 main HRPTC income limit (higher-income filers can qualify if they are age 70 or above).

FSFC, meanwhile, would be available to about 70,000 individuals.


### Conclusion

The Financial Support for Families with Children Amendment Act of 2023 proposes a refundable credit of up to $1,000 per child for low-income families. The program would take effect for the 2024 tax year, issuing its first refunds in early 2025.

Given full take-up, PolicyEngine estimates that it would cost about $27 million, reach 10% of the DC population, reduce child poverty by about 5%, and reduce a broad measure of income inequality by 0.3%.

Beyond data limitations, a dynamic macroeconomic model may project different results than we do. Standard labor supply models consider the extent to which a program affects net income (“income effect”) and the extent to which it affects one’s marginal tax rate (“substitution effect”). Compared to the District Child Tax Credit, the FSFC would create both effects in larger magnitudes, since it increases income more on a relative basis for those affected (by targeting low income households) and phases out at a faster rate (adding ten rather than two percentage points to marginal tax rates).

As policymakers and stakeholders evaluate the FSFC in the context of existing programs like TANF, the DCTC, and the HRPTC, a comprehensive understanding of each proposal’s unique aspects will be essential for informed decision-making. This analysis serves as a basis for further discussion and evaluation of the potential effects of the FSFC on families and children across various income levels in Washington, D.C.

#### Discover PolicyEngine’s new GPT-4 integration and audience modes.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*zNfHe2-ZB1dny22o)

Just two weeks ago, we [unveiled our ChatGPT integration](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/2023-03-17-automate-policy-analysis-with-policy-engines-new-chatgpt-integration), which allowed users to generate policy analysis by adjusting parameters in PolicyEngine and interacting with [OpenAI’s chatbot](http://chat.openai.com). Shortly after, OpenAI granted us access to the [GPT-4 API](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4), and we’ve been hard at work finding the best ways to harness its power to enhance PolicyEngine’s capabilities.

Today, we’re excited to launch our revamped **Analysis** product. Now, when you design or retrieve a policy reform in PolicyEngine, you can choose from three levels of policy knowledge and generate a comprehensive report that combines AI-generated computational content with interactive charts. Our goal is to provide a more engaging, personalized experience for our users. Here’s a look at how it works and what you can expect.


### How it works

PolicyEngine now comes with built-in GPT-4 integration, automatically generating a GPT-4 prompt to evaluate policy reform impacts. Users can access this analysis in the “Analysis” tab within the policy editor, with content tailored to their selected audience mode. This accommodates different levels of expertise and background knowledge.

Our new audience modes include:

- ELI5: Explain Like I’m 5 — For users who prefer simple language and basic explanations.
- Normal: For policy analysts with some background in economics and policy.
- Wonk: For seasoned policy analysts who prefer concise, technical language.

These modes allow users to customize the analysis based on their target audience, making the generated content more accessible and relevant.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Ni8xmhYDez5lQdlV)

Once you’ve chosen a mode, you can generate a report. GPT-4 weaves a narrative from our results, and we incorporate our interactive charts to automatically describe the policy reform using computationally precise natural language.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*odCcFVHAA5i20GvK)


### A comparison of ELI5, Normal, and Wonk modes

In our mission to make public policy more personal and accessible, PolicyEngine now offers three audience modes for our built-in GPT-4 integration: ELI5, Normal, and Wonk. These modes cater to varying degrees of familiarity with policy analysis, giving users an instant, customized policy analysis experience.

To better illustrate the differences between the modes, here are some quotes from each, applied to [President Biden’s proposal to restore the American Rescue Plan Act’s Earned Income Tax Credit expansion](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/2023-03-27-restoring-arpa-eitc):

**ELI5:** “The ‘Restoring the ARPA EITC’ policy helps people with lower incomes get more money from the government. It makes it easier for younger and older people to get this help and gives them more money. This change costs the government about $9.8 billion and helps reduce poverty a little bit.”

**Normal:** “The ‘Restoring the ARPA EITC’ policy reform increases the Earned Income Tax Credit for childless taxpayers, resulting in a total budgetary impact of -$9.8 billion. It leads to a decrease in poverty rates and a slight reduction in income inequality, benefiting lower-income deciles more significantly than higher-income deciles.”

**Wonk:** “The hypothetical tax-benefit policy reform ‘Restoring the ARPA EITC’ alters EITC parameters, yielding a -$9.8 billion budgetary impact. This reform reduces poverty rates and produces a negligible decrease in income inequality, with the most considerable relative income increases observed in the first and second deciles.”

By offering these three audience modes, we aim to make policy analysis more accessible to a wider range of users, from those with limited policy knowledge to seasoned policy analysts. You can explore examples of each mode in the appendix of this post, and choose the one that best suits your needs or the needs of your target audience when creating reforms in the future.


### Embracing AI innovation

At PolicyEngine, we’re constantly seeking innovative ways to utilize AI to make public policy more accessible and personal. Our latest GPT-4 integration and audience modes are just the beginning. We are committed to leveraging the power of AI to further enhance our tools, enabling better policy understanding and decision-making for researchers, policymakers, and advocates alike.


### Conclusion

PolicyEngine’s integrated GPT-4 capabilities and new audience modes offer instant personalized policy analysis, transforming the way users interact with and engage in policy evaluation. By providing a seamless, customized experience, we aim to empower users in their pursuit of better policy understanding and more informed decision-making. Give it a try today and experience the advantages of AI-powered policy analysis for yourself!


### Examples

Each applies to the reform to [restore the ARPA EITC](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/2023-03-27-restoring-arpa-eitc).


### ELI5

The proposed policy reform, called “Restoring the ARPA EITC,” is for the year 2023 in the United States. It makes several changes to the current law:

The maximum age for people without children to get support from the government (called EITC) is raised from 64 to 100 years old.

The minimum age for the same group is lowered from 25 to 19 years old.

The maximum amount of money given by EITC is increased from $600 to $1,502.

The rate at which the EITC amount increases as people earn more money is doubled from 7.65% to 15.3%.

The rate at which the EITC amount decreases as people earn even more money is also doubled from 7.65% to 15.3%.

The point at which the EITC amount starts decreasing is raised from $9,800 to $11,610.

These changes were analyzed using a computer program called PolicyEngine US v0.259.0 and data from the 2021 Current Population Survey March Supplement. The analysis showed that this policy reform would cost the government around $9.8 billion.

When looking at how people’s incomes change because of this reform, we can see that those with lower incomes benefit more. For example, people in the lowest 10% of incomes gain an average of $106, while those in the highest 10% gain an average of $31. {{decileRelativeImpact}}

The policy reform also has a small impact on poverty, which is a measure of how many people are living with not enough money to meet their basic needs. The overall poverty rate decreases slightly from 6.8% to 6.7%. The biggest change is seen among adults (people aged 18–64), with the poverty rate decreasing from 6.9% to 6.7%. {{povertyImpact}}

Inequality, which is a measure of how unevenly money is distributed among people, is also slightly affected by this policy reform. The Gini coefficient, a number used to measure inequality (with 0 being perfect equality and 1 being complete inequality), decreases slightly from 0.394 to 0.394. The share of income held by the top 10% and top 1% of households also decreases a little. {{inequalityImpact}}

In simpler terms, this policy reform helps people with lower incomes by giving them more financial support from the government. It has a small impact on reducing poverty and making the distribution of money more equal among people.


### Normal

The hypothetical tax-benefit policy reform, Restoring the ARPA EITC, involves several changes to the current Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) parameters for 2023 in the US. The provisions of the reform include:

The maximum age for childless EITC eligibility is increased from 64 to 100.

The minimum age for childless EITC eligibility is decreased from 25 to 19.

The maximum EITC amount for childless filers is increased from $600 to $1,502.

The EITC phase-in rate for childless filers is doubled from 7.65% to 15.3%.

The EITC phase-out rate for childless filers is also doubled from 7.65% to 15.3%.

The EITC phase-out starting point for childless filers is increased from $9,800 to $11,610.

Using PolicyEngine US v0.259.0 and the 2021 Current Population Survey March Supplement microdata, we can analyze the impacts of these changes.

The reform results in a total budgetary impact of -$9.8 billion, with tax revenues decreasing by $9.8 billion and no change in benefit spending.

Looking at income deciles, the reform’s effects are as follows:

{{decileRelativeImpact}}

The first decile sees an average income increase of $106, or 0.66%.

The second decile sees an average income increase of $119, or 0.36%.

The third decile sees an average income increase of $96, or 0.21%.

The fourth decile sees an average income increase of $71, or 0.12%.

The fifth decile sees an average income increase of $55, or 0.08%.

The sixth decile sees an average income increase of $61, or 0.07%.

The seventh decile sees an average income increase of $50, or 0.05%.

The eighth decile sees an average income increase of $41, or 0.03%.

The ninth decile sees an average income increase of $41, or 0.03%.

The tenth decile sees an average income increase of $31, or 0.01%.

In terms of poverty impacts, the reform has the following effects:

{{povertyImpact}}

The overall poverty rate, measured by the Supplemental Poverty Measure, decreases from 6.8% to 6.7%.

The adult poverty rate decreases from 6.9% to 6.7%.

The child poverty rate decreases from 5.9% to 5.9%.

The senior poverty rate decreases from 7.7% to 7.6%.

For deep poverty rates:

The overall deep poverty rate decreases from 1.8% to 1.8%.

The adult deep poverty rate decreases from 2.0% to 2.0%.

The child deep poverty rate remains at 1.2%.

The senior deep poverty rate remains at 1.7%.

When comparing the baseline and reform poverty and deep poverty rates by gender, the reform leads to relative decreases in poverty rates for both females (from 7.1% to 7.0%) and males (from 6.5% to 6.4%). The deep poverty rates also decrease for both females (from 1.8% to 1.8%) and males (from 1.8% to 1.8%).

Regarding inequality metrics, the reform has the following effects:

{{inequalityImpact}}

The Gini coefficient of income inequality decreases slightly from 0.3944 to 0.3938.

The share of income held by the top 10% of households decreases slightly from 30.4% to 30.4%.

The share of income held by the top 1% of households remains nearly constant at 7.5%.

Overall, the Restoring the ARPA EITC reform leads to a decrease in poverty rates and a slight reduction in income inequality. The reform impacts lower-income deciles more significantly than higher-income deciles, with the most considerable relative income increases observed in the first and second deciles.


### Wonk

The hypothetical tax-benefit policy reform for 2023 in the US, known as “Restoring the ARPA EITC,” includes several changes to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) parameters. The impacts described below are based on PolicyEngine US v0.259.0 and the 2021 Current Population Survey March Supplement microdata. The following provisions detail the changes from the baseline to the reform values:

The maximum age for childless EITC eligibility is increased from 64 to 100.

The minimum age for childless EITC eligibility is reduced from 25 to 19.

The maximum EITC amount for childless taxpayers is raised from $600 to $1,502.

The phase-in rate for childless taxpayers is increased from 7.65% to 15.3%.

The phase-out rate for childless taxpayers is increased from 7.65% to 15.3%.

The phase-out start for childless taxpayers is raised from $9,800 to $11,610.

The reform has a total budgetary impact of -$9.8 billion, resulting from a -$9.8 billion decrease in tax revenues and no change to benefit spending.

Regarding income deciles, the {{decileRelativeImpact}} shows that the reform leads to an income gain for 11.2% of the first decile and a gain for 9.5% of the second decile. The reform has no negative income impact, and 88.8% of households experience no change in income.

Poverty impacts, measured using the Supplemental Poverty Measure, show the following relative changes: {{povertyImpact}}

Adult poverty rate decreases from 6.9% to 6.7%.

Overall poverty rate decreases from 6.8% to 6.7%.

Child poverty rate decreases from 5.9% to 5.9%.

Senior poverty rate decreases from 7.7% to 7.6%.

The deep poverty rates, also measured using the Supplemental Poverty Measure, show the following relative changes:

Adult deep poverty rate decreases from 2.0% to 2.0%.

Overall deep poverty rate decreases from 1.8% to 1.8%.

Child deep poverty rate remains at 1.2%.

Senior deep poverty rate remains at 1.7%.

The reform has the following effects on poverty and deep poverty rates by gender:

Female poverty rate decreases from 7.1% to 7.0%.

Male poverty rate decreases from 6.5% to 6.4%.

Female deep poverty rate decreases from 1.8% to 1.8%.

Male deep poverty rate remains at 1.8%.

Inequality impacts are as follows: {{inequalityImpact}}

Gini coefficient of income inequality slightly decreases from 0.394 to 0.394.

Share of income held by the top 10% of households decreases from 30.4% to 30.4%.

Share held by the top 1% remains at 7.5%.

### How much should James Medlock donate to GiveDirectly?


#### We built a mini-app with the `policyengine-us` Python package to crunch the implications of a Twitter bet.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Pm5cpwxSz4uZTjD_)

[Jump to the tool](https://policyengine-james-medlock-donation-solver.streamlit.app/)

One week ago, Twitter user James Medlock tweeted:


> 

The next day, entrepreneur and investor Balaji Srinivasan agreed by quote-tweet:


> 

That is, Srinivasan, the former CTO of Coinbase, is betting that Bitcoin will exceed $1 million US dollars within 90 days.

This bet [appears to be moving forward](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1638611778006560768). When discussing how he’d use the potential winnings, Medlock tweeted:


> 

[GiveDirectly](http://givedirectly.org) is a charity that gives unconditional cash transfers to low-income households. Medlock [plans to give an unrestricted grant](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1637848723052167168), which GiveDirectly currently directs to Africa.

Should Medlock win his bet, how much should he donate to GiveDirectly to fulfill his pledge? The interaction between charitable donations and tax liability means that answering this question requires a model of the tax code — like PolicyEngine’s.

Using [our ](http://github.com/policyengine/policyengine-us)`policyengine-us`[ Python package](http://github.com/policyengine/policyengine-us) — the same package that powers our web app — and the [Streamlit](http://streamlit.app) dashboarding software, [we built a tool](https://policyengine-james-medlock-donation-solver.streamlit.app/) to calculate how much Medlock should give. The amount to give also depends on other circumstances of Medlock’s finances and household, and our tool includes levers to explore different scenarios.

We find that Medlock should give between $333,000 (if he has at least $4 million in other income) and $565,000 (if he has no other income).


### Who is James Medlock?

James Medlock ([@jdcmedlock](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock?lang=en)) is a pseudonymous Twitter account known for his social and economic policy content. Relevant information for his taxes include:

- Lives in Oakland, California
- Married
- Doesn’t have children (though he previously cared for a cat, Midnight)
- Self-employed
- 33 years old (his profile picture is a portrait of economic anthropologist Karl Polanyi as an older man)


### Using our calculator

[Our calculator](https://policyengine-james-medlock-donation-solver.streamlit.app/) runs Medlock’s household through the policyengine-us Python package via the Streamlit dashboarding app. We consider the above characteristics, and then let users set employment and self-employment income for Medlock and his wife.

As an example, suppose Medlock earns $100,000 from self-employment, and his wife earns $100,000 from employment. We would enter this as so:


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*GnNvsUqhT-LxtSpt)

[The main PolicyEngine app shows](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=16581) that, between payroll tax, self-employment tax, federal income tax, and California income tax, they would pay $58,949 in taxes, leaving a net income of $141,051 (they would not be eligible for any benefits).¹

Now with $1 million in gambling winnings, their [tax bill will rise $436,115](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=16582) from $58,949 to $495,064; federal income taxes rise from $26,967 to $361,051, California income taxes rise from $10,202 to $112,233, and payroll and self-employment taxes stay the same. Their net income rises by the remaining $563,886 to $704,937 if he doesn’t donate anything.

To take home $300,000, they might consider donating $700,000. But if they did so, their [taxes would rise $119,088](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=16583), leaving them with only $300,000 — $119,088 = $180,912 net. How much less than $700,000 of a donation will offset the tax change?

Our app shows that, for Medlock’s net income to rise by $300,000, he should donate **$484,848**. [In this scenario](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=16586), his taxes would rise $215,235. (This actually leaves him $299,917; we run an optimization process that gets within $100 or so to save time.)

We also show various donation scenarios as a table:


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*PCSgFGaaV70lLv8P)

And as a Plotly chart:


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*BG6ygtFTdgcXdm_a)

Calling the `policyengine-us` `Simulation` object with `axes` makes it easy and fast to simulate many scenarios like this. All in all, the app required 224 lines of Python code, including text and charts. See the full program at[ github.com/PolicyEngine/james-medlock-donation-solver](http://github.com/PolicyEngine/james-medlock-donation-solver/) and the app at [policyengine-james-medlock-donation-solver.streamlit.app](https://policyengine-james-medlock-donation-solver.streamlit.app/).


### Conclusion

While most of our users interact with our software through the web app, our Python packages provide flexible analysis, especially paired with dashboarding tools like Streamlit. We’ll be watching the Medlock-Srinivasan bet, and building more tools to answer one-off questions outside our main app, including those around charitable giving. Stay tuned!

#### PolicyEngine estimates the distributional impact of two provisions and the household impact of four provisions.

[See how the proposal would affect your household.](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=5842&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Uc4c7y9AN_NHOYkx0ZL8Lg.png)

On Monday, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey introduced her [fiscal year 2024 budget recommendation](https://www.mass.gov/doc/fy-2024-budget-recommendation-brief-providing-meaningful-tax-relief), which included five main proposals:

- Replacing the existing dependent and dependent care credits with a Child & Family Credit of $600 per qualifying dependent
- Reducing estate taxes
- Increasing the cap on the renter’s tax deduction from $3,000 to $4,000
- Doubling the maximum Senior Circuit Breaker Credit
- Reducing the rate on short term capital gains from 12% to 5%

PolicyEngine models the personal income tax code of Massachusetts, including each of the provisions Healey seeks to modify, except the estate tax. Our microsimulation model also supports population-wide impacts of two of the provisions: the Child & Family Credit and the capital gains reform. PolicyEngine estimates that these two provisions would together benefit 38% of the Massachusetts population and reduce the Gini index of income inequality by 0.2%. Our cost projections fall 15% below the state’s, though we can attribute at least some of this divergence to inaccuracies in the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey.

This post describes these provisions, examines the impact on three hypothetical households, and shows our microsimulation model’s distributional impacts for the available provisions.


### Governor Healey’s Budget Recommendation

[A report from John Caljouw](https://www.mass.gov/doc/fy-2024-budget-recommendation-brief-providing-meaningful-tax-relief/download), the Massachusetts Finance Director, describes and costs the core provisions of Governor Healey’s proposal.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*UhP_0DIrLTDke_Ia)

Here we detail each provision.


### Child & Family Credit

[See the impact of the Child & Family Credit on your household](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=5843&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)** and **[on Massachusetts](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=5843&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)**.**

Currently, Massachusetts families can claim one of the following two refundable tax credits:

- Dependent Tax Credit, which provides $180 to children up to age 11
- Dependent Care Tax Credit, which provides up to $240 per child, also up to two children, up to age 12 and phasing in with the lesser of the filer head and spouse’s earnings (similar to the federal Child and Dependent Care Credit)

[As she did in her gubernatorial campaign last year](https://maurahealey.com/issues/child-tax-credit/), Governor Healey proposes to replace these with a Child & Family Credit of $600 per qualifying dependent. The Child & Family Tax Credit is structured as the Dependent Tax Credit, except that it increases the amount from $180 to $600, increases the age limit from 11 to 12, and removes the child cap.


### Estate tax

Governor Healey proposes eliminating any Estate Taxes for estates with a value of less than $3,000,000 and providing a non-refundable Estate Tax credit of up to $182,000 for estates valued above $3,000,000. PolicyEngine does not model estate taxes.


### Renter tax deduction increase

[See the impact of the renter tax deduction increase on your household.](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=5370&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

Massachusetts provides a tax deduction of up to 50% of filers’ yearly rent, capped at $3,000. Governor Healey proposes raising this to $4,000.


### Senior Circuit Breaker Credit increase

[See the impact of the Senior Circuit Breaker Credit increase on your household.](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=5828&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)

Massachusetts provides a Senior Circuit Breaker Tax Credit, which reduces tax liabilities for filers aged 65 or older, depending on their income, rent, and property tax, in particular when rent and property tax exceed 10% of one’s income. Governor Healey proposes doubling the maximum credit from $1,200 to $2,400.


### Short-term capital gains cut

[See the impact of the short-term capital gains cut on your household](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput&reform=5830&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)** and **[on Massachusetts](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=5830&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)**.**

Massachusetts currently taxes most income at 5%, except income exceeding $1 million (9%) and short term capital gains (12%). The federal government and two other states also tax capital gains differently depending on whether the assets have been held for a year. Governor Healey proposes equalizing short and long term capital gains rates by reducing the short term rate from 12% to 5%.


### Household examples

To illustrate the impact of the four policies, we show how they would affect three hypothetical households: a family of four with childcare expenses, single renter with short-term capital gains, and senior homeowning couple. In each case, we show the impact to net income and marginal tax rates as the household head’s earnings vary.


### Family of five with childcare expenses

Consider this family of five:

- Spouse earns $20,000 per year, one infant, one six-year-old child, and one ten-year-old child
- Renting in Norfolk County, and paying $3,600 per month, Zillow’s estimated median for three-bedroom homes in Massachusetts
- Paying the median center-based infant care cost in Norfolk County, which the US Department of Labor estimates at $26,409 per year in 2022 (the highest in Massachusetts)
- No childcare costs for the six- and ten-year-old children

Governor Healey’s proposal would [provide them a net benefit](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&reform=5842&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=9150) if they earn above $8,000, and $50 if they earn at least $9,500. This is the earnings range over which they would pay income taxes, and where the renter tax deduction begins to reduce their taxable income.

Overall, this family would benefit mainly from the consolidation of the Dependent Credit and the Dependent Care Credit into the Family & Child Tax Credit. Current law entitles them to a maximum credit of $240 per child, up to a max of two children, giving them $480. Governor Healey’s proposal would make three of their children eligible for a $600 credit, [producing a total credit of $1,800](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=5842&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=9183). Compared to current law, Governor Healey’s proposed Renters Deduction increase would also reduce their [income tax liability by $50](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=5842&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=9183).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*OP5yHLdqVl6UEIKq)


### Single renter with short-term capital gains

Consider a single person paying $2,050 per month in rent, [Zillow’s estimated median](https://www.zillow.com/rental-manager/market-trends/ma/?bedrooms=0) for studios in Massachusetts.

Governor Healey’s proposal would [provide them a net benefit](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=5842&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=9109) if they earn above $8,000, and $50 if they earn at least $9,500. This is the earnings range over which they would pay income taxes, and where the renter tax deduction begins to reduce their taxable income.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*UhFSHuDxId6dchbM)

The reform [lowers their marginal tax rate](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&reform=5842&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=9109) between $8,000 and $9,500 earnings by between zero and five percentage points. The [cuts to the short-term capital gain rate](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=5842&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=9216) are responsible for the majority of the benefit in this case, saving this individual $8,092.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*y1BvVcRcT2GzdAh1)


### Senior homeowning couple

Finally, consider a couple, each 70 years old and owning a home.

Each receives $21,348 per year in Social Security retirement benefits, the average according to the [Social Security Administration.](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/stat_snapshot/)

Their home is worth $545,865, [Zillow’s estimated median for the state,](https://www.zillow.com/home-values/26/ma/) and they pay a 1.12% property tax rate, [SmartAsset’s estimated average](https://smartasset.com/taxes/massachusetts-property-tax-calculator#:~:text=Overview%20of%20Massachusetts%20Taxes&text=The%20median%20annual%20property%20tax,the%20national%20average%20at%200.99%25.) for the state. That is, they pay $6,114 per year in property taxes.

Governor Healey’s proposal would [provide them a $784 net gain if they have no earnings](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=5842&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=9123), falling to zero if they earn at least $8,000.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2krJxIELH3ov4klK)

This is the income range over which the reform raises the Senior Circuit Breaker Credit.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*e7JwEFHk8Vj4uDeQ)

The reform increases the filer’s marginal tax rate by ten percentage points in this phase-out range.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*WdJEv_z7HgdyDK42)


### Impact on Massachusetts

PolicyEngine’s microsimulation model pairs our tax-benefit rules engine with the Current Population Survey to estimate the aggregate impact of policy reforms. As the CPS does not contain information about households’ rent, property taxes, or inheritance, we estimate only the impact of the Child & Family Credit and the capital gains reform.


### Budget

Compared to the Finance Director’s report, PolicyEngine projects lower costs of each provision: 11% lower for the Child & Family Credit and 35% lower for the capital gains cut. We will release a [more accurate version of the CPS](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-12-28-enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis) this year to address under-reporting of income and benefits.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*A_fXJDNYYLxJ2f61JzBjnA.png)

[The Child & Family Credit would reduce the Gini index](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=5365&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) of income inequality by 0.2%, while the [capital gains cut would increase the Gini index](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=5830&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) by less than 0.1%.


### Distributional impact

Together, the two provisions PolicyEngine models population impacts for — the Child & Family Credit and the short-term capital gains cut — would [increase the average household’s net income by $173](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=5902&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), disproportionately among higher income households.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ViMykxuBpi5dmu2ekpTl7g.png)

These provisions would [raise the average household’s net income by 0.2%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&reform=5902&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), disproportionately among lower income deciles.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pbN71nCWONDxm48BnCdkOw.png)

[38% of Massachusettsans](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=5902&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) live in households that would benefit from the two provisions. A larger share of higher-income households would gain, while a larger share of lower-income households would gain at least 5% of net income (dark green). The provisions do not leave any households worse off than baseline policy.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mp0yQsc2_A5tTX3KDE39WA.png)

PolicyEngine projects [no poverty impact](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=5902&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) of the Child & Family Credit and short-term capital gains cut, while deep poverty (the population share in households with resources below half their poverty line) would [fall 1.6%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&reform=5902&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).

*PolicyEngine’s poverty impacts in small states are noisy, due to using a single year’s Current Population Survey.*


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FxLPdCVJYlXYqVvBWmjSDw.png)

The two provisions would [reduce each measure of income inequality](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=5902&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) we report.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FN1z8kPnbj_pDk9Yi_pR5A.png)

While the reforms alter marginal tax rates, we do not project any [impact on cliffs](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=5902&region=ma&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2). Like poverty estimates, cliffs are a dichotomous household outcome that can be noisy in small states.


### Conclusion

Governor Healey’s FY 2024 Budget Recommendation proposes several significant policy changes that would impact households in Massachusetts in diverse ways. PolicyEngine’s microsimulation model provides valuable insight into the potential impact of these proposals on different segments of the population. While further analysis may be required to fully understand the impact of these policies on the residents of Massachusetts, PolicyEngine’s ability to enable detailed analysis of policies is a valuable tool for policymakers in designing and evaluating policy proposals. As Massachusetts moves forward with its budget process, PolicyEngine’s analysis can provide valuable information to policymakers and support evidence-based decision-making.

## Restoration of the american rescue plan act’s expanded child tax credit

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/restoration-of-the-american-rescue-plan-acts-expan/
**Published:** 2023-02-10
**Description:** ### Restoration of the American Rescue Plan Act’s expanded Child Tax Credit

### Restoration of the American Rescue Plan Act’s expanded Child Tax Credit


#### PolicyEngine computes how the 2021 policy would affect Americans and America in 2023.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*BPJw7lg2Hv9UpjYP)

In [Tuesday’s State of the Union speech](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/02/07/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-prepared-for-delivery/), President Joe Biden called to


> restore the full Child Tax Credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.

Biden may have been referring to the Child Tax Credit (CTC) expansion under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), which expanded the CTC in several ways. Following our [Child Tax Credit report released yesterday](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/2023-02-09-the-child-tax-credit-in-2023), this report describes ARPA’s CTC expansion, and PolicyEngine’s predicted impacts of restoring that expansion.


### What is the Child Tax Credit?

President Bill Clinton introduced the Child Tax Credit in 1997, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 expanded it to create its current structure. For instance, in 2023, a married filer with one five-year-old child receives the following benefit from the CTC based on their earnings ([view this in PolicyEngine here](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962)):


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*8VNzHFmDkAEmKVAp)

As we explain in our [Child Tax Credit article](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/2023-02-09-the-child-tax-credit-in-2023), the credit phases in with income due to *partial refundability *and also phases out with income. Refundable credits can reduce one’s tax liability below zero, while the value of non-refundable credits cannot exceed one’s tax liability. Part of the Child Tax Credit, the *Additional Child Tax Credit*, is refundable, and the ACTC also phases in with income; the remainder is non-refundable.


### How did the American Rescue Plan Act expand the Child Tax Credit?

For the 2021 tax year only, the American Rescue Plan Act made four major changes to the CTC:

- Extended eligibility to 17-year-olds
- Raised the maximum amount from $2,000 per child to $3,600 for children under age 6 and $3,000 for children aged 6 to 17; this bonus phases out for parents with income exceeding $75,000 (single) or $150,000 (married)
- Made the credit fully refundable
- Prepaid half the expected 2021 credit on a monthly basis, beginning in July 2021

### How would restoring the ARPA CTC expansion affect households?

[Let’s return to the married family with a five-year-old child.](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=3227) Their maximum credit rises from $2,000 to $3,600. Parents with no income don’t benefit from the CTC today, so the combination of the increased credit and full refundability provides them the full $3,600. The benefit phases out to $1,600 if their income ranges from about $36,000 to $150,000, and the reform no longer provides a net benefit to households with income of about $181,000 or more.

[Marginal tax rates rise](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=3227) in each of the income ranges where the benefit phases out.

You can estimate how reinstating the ARPA CTC expansion would affect your own household by [entering your information here](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).


### How would restoring the ARPA CTC expansion affect the US?

We estimate that [restoring the ARPA CTC expansion would cost $100.2 billion](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=3826&focus=policyOutput.netIncome&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) in 2023. When scoring ARPA (2021 only), the Joint Committee on Taxation [estimate](https://www.jct.gov/publications/2021/jcx-14-21/)d a cost of [$109.5 billion](https://www.jct.gov/publications/2021/jcx-14-21/). [OpenRG estimated $100.7 billion](https://www.openrg.com/reports/QN_ARPA_Distribution.pdf) using the open source Tax-Calculator model (I coauthored this analysis).

While the ARPA CTC expansion provides greater benefits to low-income families than higher-income families, it [provides less to low-income households](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) than middle-income households because they have fewer children. The program also provides high-income families less because of the phase-out.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qAUaf1GWBDmMtf1L)

As a percentage of net income, however, restoring the ARPA CTC would strictly [provide greater benefits to lower income deciles](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*YCCpCYPTm7MQoMW6)

Restoring the ARPA CTC would [benefit households comprising 41% of Americans](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), disproportionately those in the fourth through eighth income deciles ([the current CTC benefits 45% of Americans](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/2023-02-09-the-child-tax-credit-in-2023)). It would raise net income by at least 5% for 27% of Americans, disproportionately those in the fourth and fifth income deciles.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Mmbr7KNvXN9YLM79)

[Poverty would fall by 9%, and child poverty would fall 37%.](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) When evaluating the ARPA CTC’s impact on child poverty in 2021, the [Niskanen Center](https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Analysis-of-the-Romney-Child-Allowance_final.pdf) and the [American Enterprise Institute](https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-Tax-Benefits-of-Parenthood.pdf#page=22) projected reductions of 39% and 35%, respectively.

In the State of the Union, President Biden said that the “full Child Tax Credit…cut child poverty in half”. He may have been referring to the full ARPA, which also included a round of relief checks, enhancements to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and other reforms. The Columbia Center on Poverty and Social Policy estimated that [ARPA would reduce child poverty by 56%](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/610831a16c95260dbd68934a/t/6113eddb3cde100cb68904ee/1628696027691/Poverty-Reduction-Analysis-American-Rescue-Plan-CPSP-2021.pdf). The Census Bureau reported that [child poverty fell 46% from 2020 to 2021](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2022/demo/p60-277.pdf#page=16), from 9.7% to 5.2%.

Halving child poverty with the ARPA CTC structure would require a [$4,400 benefit](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=3840&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2&household=2265), rather than $3,000 or $3,600. This would cost $177 billion, 77% more than restoring the ARPA CTC expansion.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1RnxfjLeF3NsHxT2)

Under the ARPA CTC expansion, deep poverty — the population share below half their Supplemental Poverty Measure threshold — would [fall 11%, and deep child poverty would fall 72%.](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2)


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*By0I0_qhekKlxkIv)

Restoring the ARPA CTC would [reduce each of the three income inequality measures we report](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), especially the Gini index at 1.9%. The Gini index reflects low-income households more than the top 10% and 1% income shares do, and these are the groups disproportionately affected by the ARPA CTC expansion.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Lvup1GU6M0wxFGzN)

By increasing marginal tax rates among low-income households most likely to experience [cliffs](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/2023-02-02-how-would-reforms-affect-cliffs), the [ARPA CTC expansion](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=3826&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) increases their prevalence. The [current CTC](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/2023-02-09-the-child-tax-credit-in-2023) reduces marginal tax rates in the phase-in earnings region, and lowers the cliff rate and gap by 1.0% and 0.6%, almost exactly an offset of the ARPA reform.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*o6ZxOJ5izxBcLASn)

Were the US to restore the American Rescue Plan’s expanded Child Tax Credit, two in five Americans would benefit, poverty would fall 9%, and a broad measure of inequality would fall 2%. PolicyEngine also computes impacts for any state; for example, the ARPA CTC would provide [$10 billion to Texans](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=3826&focus=policyOutput.netIncome&region=tx&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2) (the cost to the US), [benefit 46% of Texans](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=3826&focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&region=tx&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2), and [cut Texas’s child poverty rate by 32%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=3826&focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&region=tx&timePeriod=2023&baseline=2). These impacts, as well as the $100 billion federal cost and higher marginal tax rates, would likely produce macroeconomic effects that PolicyEngine does not yet model.

## The child tax credit in 2023

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/the-child-tax-credit-in-2023/
**Published:** 2023-02-09
**Description:** ### The Child Tax Credit in 2023

### The Child Tax Credit in 2023


#### We review how the program works and compute its impact with PolicyEngine US.


![Credit: DALL-E 2](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IkR8AnedUYev7wt_T6hEvg.png)

In Tuesday’s State of the Union speech, President Joe Biden called to expand the Child Tax Credit. What is the Child Tax Credit, how might it affect you, and what impact does PolicyEngine estimate it has on society? This blog post covers the bases.


### What is the Child Tax Credit?

The Clinton administration introduced the Child Tax Credit (CTC) in 1997 as a partially refundable credit. That is, some tax filers, including those with no federal tax liability, could claim a portion of the credit. The refundable portion of the credit, known as the Additional Child Tax Credit, phased in with income. The full credit value reduced tax liability towards zero, but higher-income earners phased out of the credit.

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expanded the CTC by:

- Doubling the maximum credit amount to $2,000 per child
- Increasing the refundable portion
- Extending the phase-out threshold
- Limiting the credit for children and dependents without Social Security numbers

The Joint Committee on Taxation [estimated](https://www.jct.gov/publications/2017/jcx-67-17/) that these reforms cost $544 billion from 2018 to 2027, or 37% of the $1.5 trillion net cost of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act over that period.

For the 2021 tax year only, the American Rescue Plan Act further expanded the CTC in several ways. ARPA:

- Extended eligibility to 17-year-olds
- Raised the maximum amount from $2,000 per child to $3,600 for children under age 6 and $3,000 for children aged 6 to 17; this higher amount is available to parents with income below $75,000 (single) or $150,000 (married)
- Made the credit fully refundable
- Prepaid half the expected 2021 credit on a monthly basis, beginning in July 2021

Other than ARPA, the CTC structure has not changed since 2018, aside from some parameters increasing with inflation (though the law fixes the maximum credit value at $2,000).


### How does the Child Tax Credit affect individual households?

We can compute the impact of the Child Tax Credit in PolicyEngine by first [abolishing the Child Tax Credit](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=gov.abolitions.ctc&reform=3318&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318), and then swapping the baseline and reform. This tells us the impact of introducing the CTC compared to a baseline where it doesn’t exist, and we can use it for both individual and society-wide analysis.

Consider a [married filer with one child and $250,000 wages](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962) in 2023. They would receive the full $2,000 CTC.

If we [vary their earnings](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962), we can see how the partial refundability effectively phases the CTC in with income, and how it phases out with income as well.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*KLgJ76doY6WE95Lt)

Correspondingly, the [CTC lowers this filer’s marginal tax rates](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962) in the phase-in earnings region, and raises marginal tax rates in the phase-out region.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*MYcUq_rSgMsHu1o9)

To see how the Child Tax Credit affects your own finances and work incentives, [enter your own household information](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=intro&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&reform=2) and PolicyEngine will produce these personalized analytics.


### How does the Child Tax Credit impact society?

We can compute the impact of the Child Tax Credit in PolicyEngine by first abolishing the Child Tax Credit, and then swapping the baseline and reform. This tells us the impact of introducing the CTC compared to a baseline where it doesn’t exist. I showed how to design it below, but you can skip to the impact [here](http://localhost:3000/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318).

In 2023, we estimate that the [Child Tax Credit costs $109.9 billion](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318). As context, the Tax Policy Center estimated in September 2021 that the CTC would cost [$126.3 billion in calendar year 2023](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/tax-benefits-child-tax-credit-september-2021/t21-0223-tax-expenditure-child-tax).

Among the bottom 90% of households, the [CTC increases with income on average](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileAverageImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962), due both to the partial refundability and higher income households having more children. The top income decile has a lower benefit as the credit phases out for high income filers.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*EOZKSyWudaW5avqG)

[As a percentage of net income](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.decileRelativeImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962), the Child Tax Credit has the largest benefit for the fourth income decile.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*0zeQPrJ9p_mki-gM)

[45% of Americans benefit from the Child Tax Credit.](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.intraDecileImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962) For 30% of the population, the CTC increases household net income by at least 5%, disproportionately those in the fourth through sixth income deciles.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*wEG9Brxqq8ITG327)

[Without the Child Tax Credit](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962), we estimate that the poverty rate would be 14.4% rather than 14.1%, and that the child poverty rate would be 9.6% instead of 8.9%. That is, we project that the current CTC cuts poverty 2.1% and child poverty 6.9%.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*WWSTQpJ4f_zu8eMh)

The [CTC reduces the deep poverty rate](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.deepPovertyImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962) — the population share with income below half their Supplemental Poverty Measure threshold — by less than 0.1%.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*IW-FLe4tzpb46cbn)

The [CTC also reduces income inequality](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962) using our three measures, for example cutting the Gini index by 1.1%.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*6H6JJlR5ouBqY3-c)

The [CTC reduces the prevalence and severity of cliffs by 1.0% and 0.7%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.cliffImpact&reform=2&region=us&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318&household=2962), respectively. Cliffs occur when people who earn more have a lower net income due to taxes and withdrawn benefits. The CTC’s partial refundability lowers marginal tax rates, while its phase-out increases marginal tax rates; since low-income families disproportionately face cliffs, the marginal tax rate reductions at the low end reduce cliffs. [Read our full explainer on cliffs here.](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/how-would-reforms-affect-cliffs-c390fffcfdf7)


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*dfD9j_Hng5cTIAQH)

You can view these analytics for any US state using the drop-down menu in the right panel. For example, in Pennsylvania, the Child Tax Credit [provides an aggregate $3.8 billion](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.netIncome&reform=2&region=pa&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318) in benefits, [reduces child poverty 6.7%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.povertyImpact&reform=2&region=pa&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318), and [lowers the Gini index by 1.0%](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?focus=policyOutput.inequalityImpact&reform=2&region=pa&timePeriod=2023&baseline=3318).

In conclusion, PolicyEngine provides a variety of analytics on the Child Tax Credit (CTC). Individuals can navigate the partially-refundable structure to estimate how it affects them, and explore different earnings scenarios. Those interested in broader effects can view our estimates of the CTC’s cost and distributional impacts, such as the degree to which it reduces poverty, inequality, and cliffs across the US and individual states. As policymakers explore CTC reforms, and households continue to seek information on it, we will continue to provide personalized and [increasingly accurate](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-12-28-enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis) analytics on the policy’s impact.

## How would reforms affect cliffs?

**Published:** 2023-02-02
**Description:** ### How would reforms affect cliffs?

### How would reforms affect cliffs?


#### The PolicyEngine US app now computes the impact of custom policy reforms on the prevalence and severity of cliffs.

*We’re grateful to *[Innovation Network for Communities](https://in4c.net/)*, which funded the development of this PolicyEngine feature and report.*


### Overview

The *cliff* (a.k.a. *benefit cliff* or *welfare cliff*) is a phenomenon that occurs when an individual is worse off when their income rises, due to the government withdrawing benefits and/or levying taxes. Cliffs discourage individuals from working more hours or seeking a higher wage, and they have been a topic of concern in the US policy arena.

PolicyEngine now shows how policy reforms can avoid these cliffs. Our free and open source web app uses a comprehensive microsimulation model to compute the effects of customizable tax and benefit reforms on society and individual households.

With the [launch of the new PolicyEngine interface](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/the-new-policyengine), we have added two new measures that can be used to assess the prevalence and severity of cliffs under a given policy regime. These measures allow analysts to easily summarize the effects of custom reforms on cliffs across society.

This post examines the impact of current policy on the creation of cliffs at the household and population levels. The post also discusses how we measure the prevalence and severity of cliffs and presents a series of three policy experiments designed to reduce their occurrence. These experiments can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different reform measures and help the policy community develop more effective strategies for addressing cliffs.


### How current law creates cliffs

Users can enter their household information at [policyengine.org/us/household](http://policyengine.org/us/household) to compute their net income after taxes and benefits under current law. For example, below (left) is the result for a [single parent of a blind child in New York with $20,000 wages](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.netIncome&household=1411) (users can expand or collapse elements).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ea-iCNObVVa3blyM)

Users can also view a chart of their [net income](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.earnings&household=1411) (after taxes and benefits) with respect to their earnings (above, center). We shade the earnings region where they would be worse off due to cliffs: we informally call this the “earnings dead zone”.

We also express cliffs as spikes in the [marginal tax rate chart](https://policyengine.org/us/household?focus=householdOutput.mtr&household=1411) (above, right).


### How reforms affect cliffs for individual households

PolicyEngine US lets users adjust hundreds of policy parameters governing federal and state tax and benefit programs. For example, [this page](https://policyengine.org/us/policy?reform=12&focus=gov.ssa.ssi.income.exclusions.earned_share&region=us&timePeriod=2022&baseline=2) shows a policy experiment we consider in more detail below.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*xRJCp7bnW-lab73G)

After specifying a policy reform, the net income and marginal tax rate charts show two lines each: one for baseline (gray), and one for reform (blue). The net income chart also shows two sets of earnings dead zones in different shadings.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*s39iTSIqO-BaRzWP)

For this single parent of a blind child in New York, the SSI reform would not affect their net income or marginal tax rate at their current $20,000 earnings. But as they earn more, the reform would increase their SSI and phase it out over a longer earnings range. As a result, their marginal tax rate falls, and then rises once they reach an earnings level where it would have otherwise fully phased out.

In addition to changing marginal tax rates, the SSI reform would push the cliff from around $44,000 earnings to about $88,000 earnings. The cliff results from SNAP, for which SSI provides categorical eligibility.

This example shows that even at the individual level, even simple reforms can affect cliffs in multiple ways. For example, since this SSI reform removes cliffs for some households and creates them for others, how can we determine the net effect? To answer this question, we need a population-level perspective.


### How reforms affect cliffs in aggregate

We have added the following measures and charts:

- Cliff rateShare of households who would be worse off if each adult earned $2,000 more per year
- Cliff gapTotal net income lost by households when adults earn an additional $2,000

We selected a $2,000 increment to capture plausible margins for labor supply decisions: $2,000 is roughly a $1 per hour raise for full-time workers, or one hour per workday at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Tax analysis often applies a smaller increment, such as $1, but this will only capture cliffs in hypothetical charts, not sparser microdata. The Department of Health and Human Services’s Marginal Tax Rate series measures cliffs with $2,000 increments. See Appendix A for exploration of other increments and approaches.

We use the *cliff *nomenclature because both tax and benefit programs can create cliffs, and sometimes they interact to create cliffs that wouldn’t appear in the tax or benefit system alone. The *cliff rate* and *cliff gap* terms mirror the established *poverty rate* (share of people below the poverty line) and *poverty gap* (total amount below the poverty line across all people in poverty) terms.

Currently, we estimate that 0.5% of households face a cliff in 2023, producing a total cliff gap of $5.0 billion. In 2022, 1.7% of households faced a cliff, producing a cliff gap of $18.5 billion. The repeal of SNAP emergency allotments, scheduled for March 2023, reduces the prevalence of cliffs in 2023, as we discuss more below.


### Experiment 1: Increase the SSI earned income exclusion

We can now answer the question we previously posed: given our SSI reform creates some cliffs and removes others, how does it affect total cliffs?

As some background, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a cash assistance program for low-income seniors and people with disabilities administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA). For eligible people, the SSA calculates SSI as the difference between a maximum benefit and “countable income”. Above flat thresholds, each dollar of earned income is counted as 50 cents of countable income, meaning it creates a 50% marginal tax rate in the phase-out range.

Increasing the earned income exclusion to 75% effectively reduces SSI’s MTR to 25%. While this would not affect the cliff rate, it would reduce the cliff gap by 0.5%.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*oQaGBVePzhukcZWq)

See Appendix B for caveats around PolicyEngine’s SSI microsimulation model.


### Experiment 2: Repeal SNAP emergency allotments

Throughout the pandemic, several states have expanded the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) to provide the maximum benefit to eligible households, or an increase of at least $95 per month. While SNAP normally has a cliff due to a minimum allotment ($23 per month in 2023), the emergency allotments significantly expanded the cliff by effectively increasing the minimum allotment to the maximum allotment.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 repealed the SNAP emergency allotments, effective March 2023. We have modeled that ([see our process here](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-12-23-updating-policyengine-to-reflect-snap-reform-in-the-omnibus-bill)), making the annual emergency allotments only a sixth as generous as they were in 2022, in the 34 states and DC where they remain in place.

Repealing the SNAP emergency allotments for January and February 2023 would cut the cliff rate by 34%, from 0.5% to 0.3%, and reduce the cliff gap 14.9%, from $5.0 billion to $4.3 billion.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*MScerJywMqvSjAWJ)

In 2022, when states provided SNAP emergency allotments throughout the year, they had a larger impact on cliffs. Repealing emergency allotments would have cut the cliff rate 91%, from 1.7% to 0.2%, and cut the cliff gap 94%, from $18.5 billion to $1.1 billion.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*BWzaOy8sULhqP-X3)


### Experiment 3: Start phasing out Washington’s Working Families Tax Credit at a lower income

Washington’s provides a refundable Working Families Tax Credit, with the amount and structure depending on household size. It starts phasing out at an amount below the end of the federal Earned Income Tax Credit: $2,500 below for families with one child, and $5,000 below for those with multiple children. This creates [marginal tax rates ranging from 12% to 24%](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-us//gov/states/wa/tax/income/credits/working-families-tax-credit.html).

Phasing out the credit over a longer interval would increase MTRs for those newly in the phase-out region, and reduce MTRs for those already with earnings in the phase-out region. On a net basis, PolicyEngine finds that enlarging the phase-out region to $10,000 would have no effect on Washington’s cliff rate; however, it would lower Washington’s cliff gap by 0.4%, from $186.0 million to $185.2 million.

### Summary and future research

Government agencies and nonprofits have expanded their research into cliffs in recent years, as we summarize in Appendix C. We now provide a novel contribution to the cliff conversation: quantitative estimates of their prevalence under highly customizable reforms, alongside budgetary and distributional outcomes.


![Impacts of selected reforms on cliffs and other outcomes](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sphHryjtjLOBIRJcX30xvg.png)

However, our cliff measures are only as complete as our microsimulation model. Since we do not yet capture all tax and benefit programs (for example, childcare subsidies, housing subsidies, and state income taxes in most states), we under-report cliffs. Our [data enhancement plan](https://policyengine.org/us/blog/2022-12-28-enhancing-the-current-population-survey-for-policy-analysis) will also improve cliff modeling, especially at the state level where we rely on a small sample of households potentially subject to cliffs. As we improve our model, PolicyEngine will identify more cliffs — and more opportunities to address them.

Our policy experiments show that cliffs can be averted by making programs either more generous (increasing the SSI earned income exclusion) or less generous (repealing SNAP emergency allotments and phasing out Washington’s Working Families Tax Credit at lower incomes). In these instances, though, reforming programs with explicit cliffs had a much larger impact on cliff prevalence than reforming marginal tax rates.

As the policy community crafts policies to achieve other goals, such as budgetary constraints or poverty alleviation, they now have the tools to consider the incentive issues around cliffs as well.


### Appendix A: Alternative cliff definitions

We considered two dimensions of alternatives for cliffs:

- Earnings increment
- Grouping of people and households

We initially proposed reporting the share of adults whose net income would fall with an additional $2,000 of earnings. Further investigation revealed that reporting the share of adults would add to the PolicyEngine runtime by multiple times, since we would have to recompute a household’s net income under each adult’s increment independently. Instead, we chose to determine cliffs at the household level upon each adult increasing their earnings simultaneously.

The increment affects the resolution of the cliffs. If the increment is too low, too few households will be just below the cliff in order to experience it. If the increment is too high, it won’t capture smaller cliffs, as households will earn enough to get out of them.

While we did not intend to select a threshold as to maximize cliffs and gaps, we consulted the evidence to decide whether to stray from our original plan. Since cliffs in 2022 peaked at increments around $2,000-$3,000, we kept our original $2,000 increment.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*r7SK9ZwRhPeL7mf8)

We also considered whether to “pool” the earnings increment, i.e. to divide it across all adults in the household rather than increase each adult’s by that amount. This approach pushes the peak cliff rates and gaps to $6,000.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*MEK7DtIlWNLOkJ9G)


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*BFO-3rIyT4OP_Q72)

Since pooling the earnings increment adds complexity without producing an obvious benefit, we opted not to pool them.

*These numbers differ slightly from the current baseline cliff values for 2022, as we produced them with an earlier version of the model.*


### Appendix B: PolicyEngine’s SSI microsimulation model

The Social Security Administration determines eligibility for SSI based on four factors:

- Age
- Disability
- Income
- Assets

PolicyEngine uses the Current Population Survey for microsimulation modeling. Of these factors, the CPS only has reliable information on age and income. CPS respondents report difficulties across six areas, including vision, and they do not report assets.

Modeling SSI in reforms requires assigning eligibility independent of whether a respondent reported receiving SSI. For example, if a reform increases income eligibility limits (as in *Experiment 1* here), we need to estimate whether a respondent would be newly eligible.

We assign SSI eligibility stochastically using the following algorithm:

- Assign blindness to respondents who report vision difficulty in the CPS.
- Assign disability to respondents who report any difficulty in the CPS.
- Calculate the share of the ABD (aged, blind, or disabled) population that would meet other SSI requirements except for income, such as asset limits and disability certification, as well as take-up conditional on eligibility, in order to match the SSA’s total SSI enrollment records.We estimate that 59% of the ABD population would participate in SSI based on non-income-based eligibility requirements and take-up.
- Assign SSI eligibility randomly to 59% of the ABD population.


### Appendix C: Other cliff research

Beyond PolicyEngine, several organizations have studied cliffs:

- The Department of Health and Human Services’s Marginal Tax Rate Series
- The Congressional Budget Office’s study on Effective Marginal Tax Rates
- The Atlanta Fed’s CLIFF Dashboard
- ImagineLA’s Social Benefit Navigator for Los Angeles, using the BenefitKitchen API
- CrossPurpose’s cliff dashboard
- Georgia Center for Opportunity’s BenefitsCliffs.org calculator
- Leap Fund’s BenefitsCliff.com resource

PolicyEngine works with many of these organizations, for example through the California Social Benefit Impact Alliance and by helping the Atlanta Fed open source part of their rules engine. However, only PolicyEngine shows the impact of policy reforms on cliffs — currently, by showing how they affect individual households.

## Enhancing the current population survey for policy analysis

### Enhancing the Current Population Survey for policy analysis


#### We’ve used modern data science techniques to make PolicyEngine the UK’s most accurate microsimulation model. In 2023, we’ll do the same in the US.


![Credit: DALL-E 2](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Kfwpl9xRUYqyu3o9)

The [PolicyEngine US app](http://policyengine.org/us) uses a microsimulation model to compute the impact of custom tax and benefit reforms on the Current Population Survey (CPS). While the CPS is widely used for policy analysis, it contains inaccuracies that can impact the accuracy of policy simulations.

In 2023, we will enhance the CPS by integrating it with IRS tax records and reweighting it to minimize deviations from administrative aggregates. This enhanced dataset will be used in the PolicyEngine microsimulation app and will also be made available as an open resource for other policy research.

*We’re grateful to Dylan Hirsch-Shell for supporting this project.*


### Why is the CPS inaccurate?

The Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics run the CPS monthly. Each March, they ask deeper questions on households’ activity in the prior calendar year, in the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC). We use the CPS ASEC (which we refer to as the CPS) for our policy simulations, as do many other analysts; for example, the Census Bureau uses it to produce their [annual poverty report](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2022/demo/p60-277.html). However, the CPS has several limitations that can impact its accuracy:

- It undercaptures benefits and tax credits, leading to underestimated impacts on certain populations. For example, CPS respondents under-report SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits by about a third.
- It top-codes income variables above $1 million, which can distort the income distribution and impact policy simulations.
- With only 100,000 households, the CPS can produce volatile estimates when broken down by subpopulations, especially at the state level.
- It lacks some important information, such as assets, that can impact taxes and benefits.
- The CPS is based on data that is 1–2 years old and is not extrapolated to predict future policy impacts.

These limitations can reduce the accuracy and usefulness of the CPS for policy simulations and other research. For example, CPS-based projections will tend to underestimate the budgetary impacts of reforming SNAP or instituting a tax on top earners, and will be unable to estimate the impacts of wealth taxes or reforms to asset limits in benefit programs.


### Our plan to enhance the CPS

To address these issues, we plan to integrate several household datasets and tune them to more closely match administrative totals. This process will involve the following steps:

- Import the CPS and replace reported taxes and benefits with computed amounts from our microsimulation model.
- Duplicate the CPS, remove income variables, and replace them with imputed values from IRS tax records using our open-source synthimpute software for machine learning-based quantile regression.
- Develop a loss metric based on the differences between the survey’s aggregates and true aggregates published by the government.
- Use gradient descent to adjust the household survey weights in the duplicated CPS and minimize the loss.
- Integrate the reweighted CPS-IRS dataset with the Survey of Consumer Finances and Consumer Expenditure Survey to create a comprehensive household dataset, also with synthimpute .
- Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each subnational area (state, congressional district, state legislative district, etc.) to produce weights for those areas.

The diagram below characterizes this procedure ([see it in higher quality here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1B3EqL43W-Rfbultr6fGMqURtYSiuzg-Y3PkW2vT5lxs/preview)).


![Flow diagram of PolicyEngine’s data enhancement procedure](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*KU357kXuoE888uTy)

We have successfully implemented steps 1–5 in the UK, where our loss function has 2,664 elements.¹ While we have not yet created separate weights for each UK region, we include region-specific targets (like the CPS, the UK household survey has region identifiers).

In the US, we have completed step 1, and also made progress importing the Survey of Consumer Finances and Consumer Expenditure Survey to our data format.


### Why our approach will work

We’ve grounded our algorithm in theory and empirics to maximize accuracy.

My 2018 paper, [“Quantile regression, from linear models to trees to deep learning”](https://towardsdatascience.com/quantile-regression-from-linear-models-to-trees-to-deep-learning-af3738b527c3), compared the performance of several quantile regression techniques using holdout sets. To my knowledge, this was the first instance of such a benchmarking study, and in it I found that random forests outperformed most other models. In [follow-up research with Deepak Singh](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1E8F7S1Uvfw_3PmpS226Sl1LWV5NBi0CE), we found again that random forests outperformed other models, and that matching — perhaps the most common data fusion method for economic microsimulation — performed *worse* than any others.


![Bar chart with quantile loss by method. Matching had the highest loss, random forests had the lowest.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ToiaXsYBexc9tD_H)

This result aligns with the theory underpinning each method. By finding the nearest donor record, matching routines are almost built to overfit, while random forests are architected to avoid overfitting.² Overfitting matters because data fusion is not a linking problem, it is an out-of-sample prediction problem: none of the records in the PUF are in the CPS, and vice versa. We aim to predict the conditional distribution of variables using companion datasets, reflecting the uncertainty in these predictions.

Our reweighting routine also carries theoretical advantages over the state of the art. Institutions like the Census Bureau assign initial weights using a small number of covariates, without intending to correct for sampling bias in outcomes like food assistance participation. Analysts sometimes adjust these weights to consider more outcomes using nonlinear programming, which runs until all constraints are satisfied (e.g., each income category is within 5% of the true values). Gradient descent improves upon nonlinear programming by continuing the search: rather than merely looking for an acceptable solution, it finds an optimum after hundreds of searches (“epochs”). And because gradient descent powers deep learning models, computer scientists have built tools to make it run smoothly and quickly.

Since reweighting is also a prediction problem, we evaluate our method on holdout sets of metrics to avoid overfitting. My colleague Nikhil Woodruff has shown that our approach here [substantially improves accuracy](https://blog.policyengine.org/how-machine-learning-tools-make-policyengine-more-accurate-17af859cdd97) in the UK context, both against the original data and other microsimulation models.


![Graph showing that training losses fall in each category as gradient descent reweighting epochs continue.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Cr-l3U_V97HvNbi3)

Our UK documentation includes [evaluations that update each time we change the model](https://policyengine.github.io/policyengine-uk//model/validation.html). While we’re confident in the benefits of our two novel contributions to microsimulation data enhancement — fusing datasets with random forests-based quantile regression, and reweighting with gradient descent — we will continue experimenting with new methods and sharing our performance as the literature develops.

The CPS already produces useful projections for some policy reforms, such as national tax programs that affect the bulk of the income distribution. Our experience in the UK suggests that our data enhancement procedure can make it even more useful; we expect to cut errors by 90% for assessing more targeted policies, and also to be able to model reforms we don’t currently support, like the [newly-passed Massachusetts millionaire tax](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/what-the-millionaire-tax-in-massachusetts-means-for-the-wealthy.html).

By enhancing the CPS with IRS tax records and reweighting it to minimize deviations from administrative aggregates, we can significantly improve the accuracy of policy simulations and contribute to a more evidence-based policymaking process. We look forward to bringing these enhancements to the US and making our enhanced dataset available as an open resource for other policy research.

¹ The UK equivalents of the CPS and IRS tax records are the Family Resources Survey and Survey of Personal Incomes, respectively. Our code for enhancing UK microdata is in [this folder](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-uk/tree/master/policyengine_uk/data/datasets/frs/enhanced) within the policyengine-uk GitHub repo.

² While we expect that deep neural networks could outperform random forests with tuning, we’ve adopted random forests for their simplicity and high baseline performance.

![UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*uWQA0HBNm3IbZhO1)

Earlier today, UK Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng announced the [Growth Plan 2022](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1105989/CCS207_CCS0822746402-001_SECURE_HMT_Autumn_Statement_2022_BOOK_Web_Accessible.pdf). The plan includes several provisions affecting National Insurance, Income Tax, and Stamp Duty:

- “reducing NICs rates by 1.25 percentage points from November and cancelling the Health and Social Care Levy coming in from April 2023.” (section 3.20)
- “bring forward the 1 percentage point cut to the basic rate of income tax to April 2023” (3.21)
- “the additional rate of income tax will also be removed from April 2023” (3.22)
- “reverse the 1.25 percentage point increase in dividend tax rates from April 2023” (3.23)
- “From 23 September 2022, the government will increase the threshold above which Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) must be paid on the purchase of residential properties in England and Northern Ireland from £125,000 to £250,000.” (3.29)
- “From 23 September 2022, the threshold at which first-time buyers begin to pay residential SDLT will increase from £300,000 to £425,000 and the maximum value of a property on which first-time buyers relief can be claimed will also increase from £500,000 to £625,000.” (3.30)

[As we wrote yesterday](https://blog.policyengine.org/stamp-duties-in-policyengine-uk-6087dc05c135), PolicyEngine fuses property values across government surveys to provide the UK’s only publicly available model of stamp duties. Our unified, enhanced dataset and model allows us to score the Growth Plan’s Stamp Duty reforms alongside the Income Tax and National Insurance reforms, which we did [within minutes of its announcement](https://twitter.com/nikhil_woodruff/status/1573235941053026305) on Twitter.

### Impact on the UK population

Our static microsimulation model finds that the package, assuming all provisions occurred over the 2022 calendar year, would:

- Cost £16.2 billion
- Benefit 80% of the population, disproportionately those in higher income and wealth deciles
- Reduce poverty by 1.4%, disproportionately among seniors (1.9%)
- Increase income inequality: the policy increases the Gini index by 1.2%, the top 10%’s income share by 1.0%, and the top 1%’s income share by 2.2%

The policy has a larger net income benefit to those in higher income, both in relative and absolute terms. For example, it raises the top income decile’s net income by an average of £2,738 (2.5%) and that of the bottom decile by £45 (0.4%). The policy similarly benefits high wealth deciles more than low wealth deciles, though to a lesser degree.

### Impact on hypothetical households

The benefit of the reform increases with income for individual households, as well as in aggregate. For example, a single person with £50,000 employment income will gain £842, while a single person with £200,000 income will gain £5,220.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*9MKAdl_sTwSpw7J3)

Their marginal tax rate falls by:

- 2.2p for income between £12,570 and £50,270
- 1.2p for income between £50,270 and £150,000
- 6.2p for income above £150,000


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*phxsV1pO3hY9D9CZ)

The policy affects a family of four (married, two children) differently due to the interaction between Income Tax and Universal Credit.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*IFpdJgHe_DhBije5)

Their marginal tax rate falls less in the Universal Credit taper zone, by about 1.0p.

## Impact of the chancellor’s cost of living support package

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/impact-of-the-chancellors-cost-of-living-support-p/
**Published:** 2022-05-26
**Description:** ### Impact of the Chancellor’s Cost of Living Support package

### Impact of the Chancellor’s Cost of Living Support package


#### See the analysis in PolicyEngine UK

Today, the Chancellor of the Exchequer [announced a new Cost of Living Support package](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/millions-of-most-vulnerable-households-will-receive-1200-of-help-with-cost-of-living) of cash transfers:

- £650 to households receiving means-tested benefits
- £150 to households receiving non-means-tested disability benefits
- £300 to households receiving the Winter Fuel Payment (i.e., those with pensioners)
- £200 to households receiving energy bills, doubling the Energy Bills Support Scheme rebate announced in February and removing the need to repay it over five years

Alongside a six-month extension of the Household Support Fund, HM Treasury estimated that the package would cost £15.3bn, and be partly offset by £5bn from a new temporary Energy Profits Levy. We’ve added these four payments (not the Household Support Fund or Energy Profits Levy) to PolicyEngine. This post shows how to define the reform in PolicyEngine, compares PolicyEngine’s results to HM Treasury’s, and shows novel impacts on poverty, inequality, and households.


### Defining the reform in PolicyEngine

*Skip this section to see the results.*

To accommodate this package, we’ve added a new section to the Benefit menu in the [Policy page](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy), for the *Cost-of-living support payment*. This includes payments to each of the three new household categories: those receiving means tested benefits, those with pensioners (the qualification for receiving Winter Fuel Payment), and those receiving non-means-tested disability benefits. These are set to £0 until they become legislation.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fKtwMJpHA8ua9nti)

To model the Cost of Living Support package, set these parameters to £650, £300, and £150, respectively.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*niEvXilrDsNIERMK)

Next, navigate to the *Energy bills support* menu. This defaults to £0 because it doesn’t take effect until October. Set it to £400.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*-QfroG-AojdZbEiv)

This, however, will compare the full £400 against £0. To focus on the additional £200, we need to first set the baseline value to £200 by toggling the Baseline in the upper right and setting the credit to £200. This effectively front-loads the £200 announced in February to the beginning of the year.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ZC3T6NytGLf7n9SM)

If you made it this far, congratulations, you’ve modelled the newly announced Cost of Living Support package! Your URL should look like this: [https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?col_benefit_payment_amount=650&col_disability_payment_amount=150&col_pensioner_payment_amount=300&ebr_energy_bills_credit=400&baseline_ebr_energy_bills_credit=200](https://policyengine.org/uk/policy?col_benefit_payment_amount=650&col_disability_payment_amount=150&col_pensioner_payment_amount=300&ebr_energy_bills_credit=400&baseline_ebr_energy_bills_credit=200).


### Budgetary impact


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1QUONsnbioHZgnKl5cd3gw.png)

PolicyEngine estimates that these four programs would cost £16.2bn, 9% higher than HM Treasury’s estimate of £14.8bn. Most of this discrepancy, and the largest proportional discrepancy, comes from the payment to pensioner households receiving Winter Fuel Payment. It’s not clear how HM Treasury estimated that this program would cost £2.5bn; the [factsheet](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cost-of-living-support/cost-of-living-support-factsheet-26-may-2022) states that it is not exclusive with other payments, and [DWP forecasts 11.4m households receiving Winter Fuel Payment in 2022–23](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/benefit-expenditure-and-caseload-tables-2021), which would cost £3.4bn when multiplied by £300.


### Comparison to HM Treasury distributional impact

HM Treasury released an [“Illustrative analysis of the impact of the Cost of Living Support packages on households”](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078837/DA_May_2022_publication.pdf) along with the package announcement, including distributional impacts on English households. Here’s one chart from their report:


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*kNAJvbiWYIkVklP6)

To replicate these results, select England from the Geography menu in the Policy page. Doing so yields [this impact page](https://policyengine.org/uk/population-impact?col_benefit_payment_amount=650&col_disability_payment_amount=150&col_pensioner_payment_amount=300&ebr_energy_bills_credit=400&baseline_ebr_energy_bills_credit=200&baseline_country_specific=ENGLAND).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*SIcutajl_eFEU4Mn)

This shows that the package would increase incomes among low-income England households by a larger percentage than high-income England households (the same holds across the UK). PolicyEngine estimates slightly larger impacts than HM Treasury, aligning with our larger budgetary impact; for example, increasing the bottom decile’s income by 8% instead of 7%.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*sfXwma_6_dIT67cS)

HM Treasury also shows the impact by decile in pounds.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*mhiMc1dHvacyjXnn)

PolicyEngine estimates a lower absolute impact on low-income households than HM Treasury. Combined with the relative impact graph, these results reveal that PolicyEngine estimates a significantly lower baseline income for households in the bottom income decile than HM Treasury: £500 / 8.1% = ~£6,200, compared to £830 / 7% = ~£12,000. This is probably due to our reweighting, which improves the accuracy of our microdata, but we’ll investigate it further in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine/issues/740).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*c0wwoflvFJ-eqqor)


### Poverty and inequality impact

In addition to the decile breakdowns, PolicyEngine estimates the poverty and inequality impacts. Overall, the package lowers the poverty rate by 7%, and by 17% among pensioners.

The package has a larger effect on deep poverty–the population share whose household has net income below half its poverty threshold–lowering it by 10%, and more consistently across age groups than the poverty impact.

The policy would also lower inequality, especially measured most broadly via the Gini index, which would fall 1.8%.

### Impact on individual households

The package provides between £200 and £1,100 for each household. £650 of that depends on a household’s earnings, since it is limited to claimants of means-tested benefits. This creates a “welfare cliff” at the point where a household is no longer eligible for means-tested benefits.

For example, an unmarried person with no children will receive £850 if they earn between £0 and about £7,300 per year. Once they earn more than that, they would receive £200. Their net income after taxes and benefits would fall from £8,504 when they earn £7,300, to £7,950 when they earn £7,400. To exceed £8,504 net income, their earnings would have to rise to about £8,000; that is, they’d see less net income earning between £7,300 and £8,000.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*SPY_UZBNq8oHBK_0)

The placement and size of this “earnings dead zone” (the shaded rectangle) depends on household characteristics. For example, a family of four paying £1,000 per month for rent would see it between £67,900 and £69,100 earnings, since families can earn more and still receive means-tested benefits.

### Conclusion

PolicyEngine UK now supports payments to households receiving means-tested benefits, non-means-tested disability benefits, and Winter Fuel Payment. You can set these values to mirror the Chancellor’s announcement, or define your own household payment scheme. Our estimates generally fall within 10% of HM Treasury’s, and we’ve also produced the first poverty and inequality analyses of the package, as well as personalised estimates that reveal welfare cliffs.

## Why I'm a neoliberal

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/substack/why-im-a-neoliberal/
**Published:** Mar 18 2022
**Description:** My political philosophy and why I identify with neoliberalism - emphasizing evidence-based policy, market mechanisms, and a strong social safety net.

I'm competing in the Neoliberal Twitter account's annual bracket competition, which gives me an opportunity to explain my commitment to neoliberal ideology. I position neoliberalism as a pragmatic, evidence-based approach to solving pressing policy challenges through market mechanisms and strategic government intervention.

## What is neoliberalism?

Neoliberalism has been mischaracterized as selfish or warmongering. Instead, it's rooted in liberal values, emphasizing evidence-based policymaking and practical solutions. Key tenets include deregulation of housing and labor markets, carbon pricing, immigration, globalization, and a robust social safety net.

## Housing deregulation (YIMBYism)

I advocate for legalizing apartment construction, particularly dense infill housing near jobs and transit. Overregulated land use restricts freedom of movement, impedes economic growth, and harms the environment.

My activism includes:
- Joining YIMBY advocacy in San Francisco (2016)
- Campaigning for YIMBY pioneer Sonja Trauss's supervisor campaign (2018)
- Co-founding YIMBY Neoliberal organization (2018)
- Creating Ventura County YIMBY (2019), which gained over 1,500 followers

## Carbon pricing

Carbon taxation is the key ingredient for cutting carbon emissions. The IPCC identifies carbon pricing as crucial for cost-effective climate mitigation, and studies worldwide demonstrate its effectiveness.

Carbon pricing enjoys broad support: average net favorability across 18 polls since 2015 reached +33 percentage points. Most developed nations price carbon; the U.S. and Australia remain exceptions.

My contributions:
- Joined Citizens' Climate Lobby (2018)
- Led my local chapter and became California state coordinator
- Researched carbon dividends professionally
- Co-founded "Save the Gas Tax" campaign (2022) with 15 environmental organizations

## Social safety net

Economic growth alone cannot guarantee minimum living standards for non-workers or address perverse incentives in current welfare systems. I advocate for:

- Universal child allowances
- Cash assistance over in-kind benefits
- Universal basic income (UBI) as the logical endpoint

I founded the [UBI Center](https://ubicenter.org), conducting quantitative policy analysis, and co-founded [PolicyEngine](https://policyengine.org), a nonprofit technology platform enabling citizens to understand tax and benefit policy impacts. Means-testing creates administrative bloat and extreme marginal tax rates for low-income households.

## Conclusion

I'm an "extreme liberal" seeking the most effective policy solutions: address poverty through direct cash transfers, housing affordability through legalization rather than government management, and pollution through market-based pricing mechanisms. These neoliberal policies are transformative when combined.

## Income tax cuts rishi sunak is reportedly considering

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/income-tax-cuts-rishi-sunak-is-reportedly-consider/
**Published:** 2021-12-04
**Description:** ### Income Tax cuts Rishi Sunak is reportedly considering

### Income Tax cuts Rishi Sunak is reportedly considering


#### Explore the basic rate and additional rate cuts in PolicyEngine


![100 Parliament Street](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CXzE044rk2ZMpobYa7stoQ.png)

Yesterday, [The Times reported](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rishi-sunaks-plan-to-slash-taxes-c30wd5kzx) that UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak is considering a number of tax cuts:

- Cutting the Income Tax basic rate from 20% to 19% in 2023, and then to 18% in 2024
- Scrapping the Income Tax additional rate of 45%, lowering the tax rate to 40% for income above £150,000
- Lowering the VAT headline rate, currently 20%
- Raising the threshold for inheritance tax, currently £325,000

PolicyEngine shows that the [combined Income Tax reforms](http://policyengine.org/uk/population-impact?add_rate=40&basic_rate=18) — lowering the basic rate to 18% and scrapping the additional rate — would cost £10.1bn per year, reduce poverty by 0.3%, benefit 71% of the public, and disproportionately increase the income of higher-income households.¹


### How Income Tax works

[Income Tax](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates) nominally has four bands: a Personal Allowance, which is untaxed, and then a progressive structure of Basic (20%), Higher (40%), and Additional (45%) rates.


![gov.uk](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Cui0kUXUHRCXsH37)

However, because Personal Allowance phases out, Income Tax has six segments instead of four. Income in the Personal Allowance phase-out region (between £100,000 and £125,140), is taxed at a 60% marginal rate, as shown in this PolicyEngine graph.


![Marginal tax rate schedule from Income Tax alone (PolicyEngine).²](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ny9SRyI1vvJWQ2XM)

National Insurance and means-tested benefits significantly increase marginal tax rates, especially among low-income people, some of whom face marginal tax rates up to 69%. See [our report on the Autumn Budget Universal Credit reforms](https://blog.policyengine.org/analysing-autumn-budget-universal-credit-reforms-with-policyengine-2ce93f177428) for information and charts depicting those incentive schedules.


### PolicyEngine results

Navigating to [policyengine.org](https://policyengine.org) shows a *Policy *screen, and the left panel shows *Income tax* and *Labour income *within that. This presents the tax rates that Sunak is reportedly considering changing. The basic rate can be adjusted at the top, and the additional rate can be repealed by setting the rate to 40% to match the higher rate.


![PolicyEngine](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*oG71EhArn_TrWtGP)

PolicyEngine can show the impact of [lowering the basic rate to 19%](http://policyengine.org/uk/population-impact?basic_rate=19),³ [lowering the basic rate to 18%](http://policyengine.org/uk/population-impact?basic_rate=18), or [repealing the additional rate](http://policyengine.org/uk/population-impact?add_rate=40). It can also model combinations of repealing the additional rate and [also lowering the basic rate to 19%](http://policyengine.org/uk/population-impact?add_rate=40&basic_rate=19) or [also lowering the basic rate to 18%](http://policyengine.org/uk/population-impact?add_rate=40&basic_rate=18). The table below summarizes these five policy reforms.

The full combined policy — [lowering the basic rate to 18% and repealing the additional rate](http://policyengine.org/uk/population-impact?add_rate=40&basic_rate=18) — would be regressive, in that it would increase the net income more for higher earners than for lower earners, as a share of income.


![PolicyEngine](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qU6Vy-7GSFaZkB6x)

This policy benefits anyone with annual income exceeding the Personal Allowance of £12,570. But it only lowers marginal tax rates for people in the basic rate band — between £12,570 and £50,270 — and in the additional rate band — above £150,000.

[3] The Times estimated that a “1p cut in the basic rate of tax would cost about £6 billion a year”. This may refer to [HMRC’s estimate](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/direct-effects-of-illustrative-tax-changes/direct-effects-of-illustrative-tax-changes-bulletin-june-2021) that adjusting the basic rate by 1p would change revenues by 5.75bn in 2023–2024 and in 2024–2025. It may also, erroneously, trace to the [Liberal Democrats’ 2017 Manifesto](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/libdems/pages/1811/attachments/original/1515517284/2017_Manifesto.pdf?1515517284#page=19), which calls for a “1p rise on the basic, higher and additional rates of Income Tax to raise £6 billion”. PolicyEngine estimates that [raising each rate by 1p](http://policyengine.org/uk/population-impact?add_rate=46&basic_rate=21&higher_rate=41) would raise 5.9bn. But, in line with our 4.4bn estimate for raising only the basic rate, [HMRC estimates](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/direct-effects-of-illustrative-tax-changes/direct-effects-of-illustrative-tax-changes-bulletin-june-2021) that adjusting the basic rate by 1p would change revenues by 4.7bn in 2022–2023 (HMRC also does not adjust Scottish taxes in this analysis, and unlike PolicyEngine, they also do not adjust Welsh taxes).

## Make everyone a policymaker

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/make-everyone-a-policymaker/
**Published:** 2021-10-15
**Description:** ### Make Everyone a Policymaker

### Make Everyone a Policymaker


#### Today we’re (re)launching PolicyEngine to give the public unprecedented insight into the tax and benefit system.

Do you know how much money you make? No, not the amount in your employment contract — how much you get to take home. What about how that would change if you took some time off, or if you got a raise? How about if your favorite (or least favorite) politician got to enact the policies they talked about on the campaign trail? Or if your government enacted *your own* policy ideas?

Developed countries collect a [third of GDP in taxes](https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/revenue-statistics-highlights-brochure.pdf) — up from a quarter in 1965 — and they spend [about a third](https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/OECD2020-Social-Expenditure-SOCX-Update.pdf) of that tax revenue on cash benefits. Taxation and provision of public benefits arguably constitute the most impactful responsibilities of governments. But amid debates over designing these multi-trillion-dollar tax and benefit systems, policymakers and policy modelers have limited tools for evaluating their proposals. The public rarely sees how reforms would affect their own household. Many people have difficulty navigating even existing systems, which often include [absurdly complex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLIH7ukbE2I) benefit programs for low-income people.


### Our vision

We envision a more inclusive, evidence-based future for tax and benefit policy. A future where people of all income levels can plan their finances with a clear understanding of their tax liabilities and benefit eligibility, and how these would change with their circumstances.

Further, we envision that inclusive, evidence-based future for *policymaking. *A future where policymakers, academics, think tanks, candidates, and the public can share a common conversation around policy reforms. Where a country’s top elected official evaluates their policy idea with the same tools as the high school student learning about tax and benefit systems for the first time. Where everyone can see the impact of policy proposals on both their country and themselves. We envision a more participatory, democratic future where anyone can explore anyone else’s policy ideas with the rigor currently reserved for exclusive policy analysis shops.

**Today, we’re taking a step towards that future by launching PolicyEngine. **PolicyEngine is the world’s first product that allows anyone to reform the tax and benefit system and see how it would affect society and their own household. We’re currently live in the UK at [policyengine.org](http://policyengine.org) and we’re working on bringing it to other countries, especially the US. Here’s a video of how it works:


### How we got here

We’re Max and Nikhil, and we come to PolicyEngine from the intersection of technology, economic policy, and data science. Max worked as a data scientist at Google for several years before getting a graduate degree in economics and starting an economic policy think tank. Nikhil is trained as a computer scientist and worked as a data scientist in fintech before joining Max’s think tank. We share a passion for equitable, efficient tax and benefit policy, and a belief that technology can shine a light on the opportunities to improve those policies.

We created the first version of PolicyEngine while working at that think tank: the [UBI Center](http://ubicenter.org), which researches universal basic income policies. UBI is a simple policy, but its high cost generally requires reforms to the rest of the tax and benefit system. We sought to expand the UBI Center’s analysis from the US (where Max lives) to the UK (where Nikhil lives), but there was no open source model of the UK tax and benefit system — so we created it. There was also no web app to interact with a model of the UK system, so we created that too.


![A UBI Center report on funding universal basic income by reforming the UK personal tax allowance used the open-source microsimulation model that powers PolicyEngine.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*u2MatZNQhvAplTLa)

By the time we built something useful enough to analyse UBI policies (we used our model to write [five quantitative reports](https://www.ubicenter.org/tag/uk/) since May), we realised it was useful enough to analyse any tax and benefit reform. So, six weeks after we [beta-launched PolicyEngine as a UBI Center product](https://www.ubicenter.org/introducing-policyengine), we’re re-launching independently from the UBI Center. We’ve also made a bunch of improvements since that beta launch, from a new user interface to more robust validation to more intuitive charts to a wider array of policy controls.

We’re grateful to users and UBI Center colleagues who have explored PolicyEngine in this period and provided us feedback, and to UK [modellers](https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/files/projects/UKMOD/EUROMOD_country_report.pdf) and [agencies](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/) that provide data and information helping us build our model. We’re especially excited to strengthen our relationship with the [Policy Simulation Library](http://pslmodels.org) by joining the [PSL Foundation](http://psl-foundation.org) as a fiscally sponsored project. We’ve worked with PSL for years and aspire to the impact of their open source policy analysis tools, especially their apps for estimating [household-level](https://compute.studio/PSLmodels/Tax-Cruncher/), [US-wide](https://compute.studio/PSLmodels/Tax-Brain), and [macroeconomic](https://compute.studio/PSLmodels/OG-USA) impacts of US tax reforms. Finally, we’re indebted to the superb work of the [OpenFisca](http://openfisca.org) development team based out of the French government, which created the microsimulation framework underlying PolicyEngine.


### What’s next

Partners and the public have already found PolicyEngine useful for understanding real-world reforms and exploring new policy directions. Here are a few examples:

- We and Charles Bauman at the UBI Center produced the first report to integrate PolicyEngine, on funding universal basic income from a land value tax.
- PolicyEngine estimates that equalising Child Benefit rates between first-born and subsequent children would cost £1.7bn per year and cut child poverty by 4%.
- PolicyEngine estimates that repealing the personal tax allowance would raise 102 billion per year, and affect middle-income households more than low- and upper-income ones.
- The UBI Lab Network embedded our household calculator to their Resilience UBI proposal, showing visitors a personalised impact.

We’re excited to see these use cases, though we recognise we have a ways to go before fulfilling our full vision. To make PolicyEngine a platform for tax and benefit analysis from government to citizenry, we’re planning a few enhancements in the coming months:

- Branded policies, as demonstrated by the universal basic income parameters within the UBI Center drop-down. If you’re with a political party or think tank that would like to show your policy on our front page, please reach out to us.
- A simpler, feed-oriented user interface to explore policies.
- PolicyEngine US, and then other countries.

If you’d like to financially support our work, you can [make a donation through the PSL Foundation](https://opencollective.com/psl) (please email [contact@policyengine.org](mailto:contact@policyengine.org) to ensure your donation is properly routed). We also welcome technical contributions through GitHub (we’re entirely open source), as well as any other feedback or ideas via [contact@policyengine.org](mailto:contact@policyengine.org). To stay up to date, you can [sign up for our newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/7b89fef927ca/general) and follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/thepolicyengine), [Facebook](http://facebook.com/thepolicyengine), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/thepolicyengine), and [Instagram](http://instagram.com/policyengine).

Thank you for joining us on our journey toward better public policy.

## In appointing their newest member, the ventura city council only pretended to care about housing

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/in-appointing-their-newest-member-the-ventura-city/
**Published:** 2021-02-24
**Description:** ### In appointing their newest member, the Ventura City Council only pretended to care about housing

### In appointing their newest member, the Ventura City Council only pretended to care about housing


#### After asking each applicant about the housing crisis, most councilmembers voted for those least committed to solving it

On Saturday, the Ventura City Council held a special meeting to appoint someone to the seat of former District 4 Councilmember, now District Attorney, Erik Nasarenko, until the election in November 2022. They selected Jeannette Sanchez-Palacios, a concerning choice for housing (more on that below), but nearly selected a straight-up NIMBY, in a process that revealed the disinterest of many councilmembers in addressing Ventura’s housing challenges.

Ventura followed a similar routine from earlier this month, when Oxnard filled now-Supervisor Carmen Ramirez’s seat. We sent a questionnaire to all applicants for the Oxnard seat, and after receiving [five responses](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/207f8afe-b5f0-4a61-9572-6417bc724eb0/page/KE9fB), [we endorsed Gabe Teran](https://medium.com/vcyimby/ventura-county-yimby-endorses-gabe-teran-for-oxnard-city-council-district-2-4cf2c0f8c5e4), who ended up [getting the appointment](https://medium.com/vcyimby/newly-appointed-oxnard-councilmember-gabe-teran-stands-strong-on-housing-2990a6ee2dd2).

We also sent a questionnaire to all fourteen Ventura applicants; however, only one, design consultant John Silva, completed it. While [Silva’s responses](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14xioDqC6fddhS_editAsdtfVUNY3A9VZ/view?fbclid=IwAR1U8WRj1Abe55Y2aly9LNlF9kEy4I-lj92jH6IXqfmKrVKfaen51hHFG_s) were strongly pro-housing, we didn’t feel we had enough information about the full set of applicants to make a formal endorsement.

Thankfully, the Ventura City Council voted to ask each applicant about housing in their interviews; here’s what they asked (in addition to opening and closing statements):

- “Our community is facing a housing crisis, worsened by the current pandemic. What will you do to address rising rents and protect renters from eviction?”
- “What do you think are the top three to five priorities for the city, and what will you do as a councilmember to achieve them?”
- “Circumstances outside the city’s control can and have impacted dramatically the city’s budget. What approach will you take as a councilmember to balance the budget to address the issues?”

These questions revealed significant differences between the applicants on housing ([watch the video here](https://youtu.be/nfIY3yKj-XA)).

Several applicants acknowledged the role of the shortage. The first to speak, John Lory, [said](https://youtu.be/nfIY3yKj-XA?t=2269), “The more supply there is, the lower the rents will be, and they will increase at a lower rate.” And the final applicant, Dan Lyon, said, “We need to look at a way to increase the supply of affordable rental housing,” suggesting infill and repurposing existing properties.


### Brad Golden and John Silva supported housing development

The strongest pro-housing interview response came from Brad Golden, a manager at a real estate insurance company; here’s his full response (**emphasis mine, **all quotes lightly edited for clarity):


> Rising rents are not new to our community and California, but specific to the pandemic, our government has placed eviction protections for Covid-related hardships through the middle of this year. I believe they’ll likely extend that and I hope they do. We also have city and county tenant protections during Covid, and I hope that continues as well. Ventura extended protections for tenants to the commercial side, and I know that’s helped quite a bit too, and we the Chamber of Commerce have been active in that role. Prior to Covid, California capped rental increases at 5% plus cost of living, so no matter what, we have a rent control in place, and I know that’s helped with tenants as well.


> But we have to remain balanced for the landlords and owners as well. Over-regulating market-driven economics cannot lead to neglect of properties in the long run. Bottom line, Covid or not: we need to work on supply and demand for housing. We need to streamline the development process and build a diversified housing stock.

Golden also emphasized housing development in his list of top three priorities for the city, which included:

- A pandemic response plan
- Economic stimulation, including “an efficient development process”
- Diversified housing stock, including being “flexible with our General Plan coming up,” a point he also brought up in terms of budget sustainability

Silva’s interview response on the housing question didn’t offer specifics, but his response to our questionnaire indicated support for policies like raising height limits near transit and legalizing fourplexes in many areas.


### Jenny Lagerquist opposed housing development

The starkest contrast to Brad Golden’s pro-housing views came from Jenny Lagerquist, an engineer, who gave the following response to the housing question:


> This is a complex question. Because of the pandemic, the issue is not specific to rents and renters, I believe homeowners and business owners are feeling the same pressures. I think everyone needs to share in the solutions. So how do we propose a way forward, allowing everyone to keep their spaces and run their businesses and provide a roof over their family’s heads.


> First, we should be looking to stay in federal grants to help protect homeowners, business owners, and renters from eviction. The state did just pass an aid package to assist those hit hardest by the pandemic, so we could help educate and guide residents to this information. And then we can look at what can the city provide, are there other types of aid, local grants, temporary rent control? Affordable housing is a very complex issue and many different facets have to be considered: on transportation, some studies have shown that people actually do want to live within a reasonable commute, so the more mass transit or public transportation that’s available, the easier to renovate or build affordable housing. Just building affordable housing without proper planning is not always the answer. Affordable housing policy can actually favor owners over renters, and we need to continue to provide a balance. It also has a long history of segregation and racism and can be expensive to build based on labor and supplies, and again transportation issues have to be addressed. Developers need incentives to build and renovate low and moderate private rental market housing. Right now, most incentives are for luxury housing, especially in a state like California. The private sector won’t build more unless the incentives change, so maybe tax credits for that kind of growth. Assistance to the low income bracket is always required, and we should be studying and seeking out grants and available funding.

Lagerquist clarified her anti-development stance in the second question, saying:


> The number one priority for the city is to always try to retain the uniqueness and authenticity of Ventura. The Council has to scrutinize any development plan and encourage redevelopment of deteriorating spaces. It would behoove the council to require developers of any type of growth or expansion or rebuild or renovation, etc., to share with the cost of infrastructure and public needs. The city alone should not burden those costs. City planning should clearly demonstrate preservation of the city’s assets and aesthetics. I think water is a tremendous issue, we have to require and encourage conservation imposing permanent restrictions if needed.

Her statement that “My focus again is certainly on preservation and maintaining Ventura” aligned with her [application](https://www.cityofventura.ca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/25998/Laqerquist-Jenny_Redacted) pledge to “promote only smart growth.” Transit, funding, and water sustainability are good, but Lagerquist invokes all as classic excuses to avoid allowing development. Ventura can’t change state and federal policymaking around grants, but they can decide whether to allow new homes to be built, which would generate tax revenue to provide their own assistance programs and expand transit. Singular focus on aesthetic preservation is antithetical to that goal.


### Jeannette Sanchez-Palacios ignored the housing shortage

Jeannette Sanchez-Palacios, district director for Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, mostly avoided answering the housing question, though she did consider it a “huge issue” that Ventura has renters, and recommend building more single-family housing:


> I’ve thought about this because recently I met with a group of renters here in the city of Ventura, and let me tell you, they were all women. We know that this pandemic has impacted a lot of our minority communities. And especially women, it has driven out of the workforce, or their partners out of the workforce. And some of the women, I heard stories they were renting one room in a bigger house that they share with their teenagers. Or one of the other women there, she had just had surgery, and wasn’t working, didn’t have sick days or paid leave, so she wasn’t sure how she was going to pay rent. So this issue is very prevalent in the city of Ventura as I did my research I found that close to 19,000 renter households exist here in the city of Ventura. That’s approximately 46% of all the households in the city, almost 50%. And so for me that’s a huge issue to look at. Luckily, federal and state governments have been protecting renters. We have a new program, the emergency rental assistance program, and I think as city leaders, it’s incumbent upon us to help our residents reach these resources that are being made available to them.


> The other thing that came to mind was the community land trust programs that can get families into single family housing and in addition can help drive down the cost of rents and home prices. I think this one in particular is very important because these programs can also potentially be an avenue for the city to fulfill the Regional Housing Needs Assessment numbers, a.k.a. the RHNA numbers, which are a state mandate. The city has to look at that as we move forward and ensure that we can meet those numbers.

This response notably omits mention of our housing shortage, except to the extent that she supported obeying state law. But her past offers more insight into her housing views. When Sanchez-Palacios ran for city council in 2016, she was endorsed by [Neighbors for the Ventura Hillside](http://www.venturahillsideneighbors.com/), a NIMBY group defined by its [Ventura Vision](https://www.facebook.com/VenturaHillsideNeighbors/posts/3666729843357316):


> We will grow slowly and sustainably (meaning we will respect our water supplies and our constraints such as traffic). We will protect our environment and open space. We will preserve our rivers, beaches and natural environment. We will insist on the highest quality of architecture and design. We will maintain our small town atmosphere.

Despite the group’s name, they primarily [oppose](https://www.facebook.com/VenturaHillsideNeighbors/posts/3572397196123915) [dense](https://www.facebook.com/VenturaHillsideNeighbors/posts/3579702212060080) [infill](https://www.facebook.com/VenturaHillsideNeighbors/posts/3670263143003986) [developments](https://www.facebook.com/VenturaHillsideNeighbors/posts/3346468822050088). They’ve since endorsed some of the most well-known NIMBYs in Ventura, such as former councilmember Christy Weir, whose [website](https://www.christyweir.com/issues/) advocates “limits on ‘high density’ and mixed use development to prevent over-urbanization.” (We [endorsed Weir’s opponent](https://www.vcyimby.org/endorsements#h.acdsvj6ekvnq), Doug Halter, in his successful November 2020 run.) Sanchez-Palacios didn’t only accept the endorsement of Neighbors for the Ventura Hillside, she recorded [two](https://www.facebook.com/933553936674934/videos/1288276611202663) [promotional videos](https://www.facebook.com/VenturaHillsideNeighbors/videos/1267762573254067) with them.


### Councilmembers nearly appointed the most NIMBY of the applicants

The Ventura City Council selected their appointee in a two-stage process. First, each councilmember selected their top two applicants, and the two receiving the most votes advanced to the next round. In the second round, each councilmember selected their top applicant of these two, and the applicant with the most votes was appointed.

In the first round, councilmembers Halter and Jim Friedman voted for Golden and Silva, while the others — Lorrie Brown, Mike Johnson, Deputy Mayor Joe Schroeder, and Mayor Sofia Rubalcava — voted for Sanchez-Palacios and Lagerquist, advancing them. In the second round, Friedman and Schroeder voted for Lagerquist and the others voted for Sanchez-Palacios.

No councilmembers mentioned housing in their decisions.

Any elected official knows what statements like those from Lagerquist indicate about housing stances, yet all but Doug Halter voted for her in either the first or second round. Christy Weir may have voted for Lagerquist over Sanchez-Palacios, and if the more pro-housing opponents of Schroeder and Johnson (whom Neighbors for the Ventura Hillside also endorsed) had won in November, they might have appointed Silva or Golden instead. NIMBYism begets NIMBYism, but so too can YIMBYism beget YIMBYism.

Sanchez-Palacios suggested she may run for election in November 2022. Her NIMBY alliances and disinterest in addressing the housing shortage are concerning, but until then, we’ll be pushing her to pursue the strong housing policy Ventura needs.

### Basic income plans from congressional candidates Mike Broihier and Suraj Patel


#### Broihier and Patel are running in Democratic primaries today


![Mike Broihier (left) and Suraj Patel (right)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*XR3dp6DK4J4pHJ21)

Of the Democrats in [six states](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/todays-elections-in-kentucky-and-new-york-are-high-stakes-for-the-progressive-movement/) voting in primaries or primary run-offs today, some will see basic-income-friendly candidates on their ballot. [Mike Broihier](https://mikeforky.com/) is one of [ten candidates](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_Senate_election_in_Kentucky,_2020) running for the chance to battle Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky, while [Suraj Patel](https://www.surajpatel.nyc/) is one of [three challengers](https://ballotpedia.org/New_York%27s_12th_Congressional_District) to incumbent Carolyn Maloney in New York’s 12th congressional district (a blue district in New York City).

Broihier is a farmer and former Marine who’s earned the endorsement of former presidential candidate Andrew Yang by making UBI the centerpiece of his [economic plan](https://mikeforky.com/issues/). Patel is an attorney and business ethics lecturer who has called for a [child allowance](https://www.surajpatel.nyc/new-page) and [emergency UBI](https://medium.com/@surajpatelnyc/fiscal-response-to-covid-19-6a4384e5e89f) throughout the Covid-19 economic crisis. Here’s more on their basic income plans.


### Both support emergency UBI

Broihier and Patel join many prominent economists in calling for emergency relief payments for each person, for each month of the crisis. By avoiding means-testing, these payments could be delivered more quickly and without excluding people whose income has changed in the past couple of years (the duration the means-tested Recovery Rebates considered for determining eligibility). Both also support giving some to children as well as adults, which my research found is a [more cost-effective way](https://medium.com/ubicenter/how-universal-basic-income-can-keep-poverty-from-rising-amid-covid-19-9950e4a58030) to stabilize poverty.

Broihier [proposes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kiBlfBFx7UBdgORWqRgKUt8r6EDzVc8LcqB8-072aJU/edit) $2,000 per adult and $1,000 per child, “each and every month until this crisis has ended and the economy has been revved back up out of recession.” The US has [73 million children and 254 million adults](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=population%20by%20age&hidePreview=false&tid=ACSST1Y2018.S0101&t=Age%20and%20Sex&vintage=2018), so this plan would cost $580 billion per month, or about a third of GDP.

Patel’s [proposal](https://medium.com/@surajpatelnyc/fiscal-response-to-covid-19-6a4384e5e89f) is half that of Broihier’s: $1,000 per adult and $500 per child, “until the pandemic is contained and the Sahm Rule is no longer triggered.” The Sahm Rule, named after economist Claudia Sahm (who also supports direct payments), identifies recessions as periods when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate is 0.5 percentage points above its low from the prior 12 months. This would cost $290 billion per month.

As captured in our [Covid-19 tracker](http://covid19tracker.ubicenter.org), several other members of Congress support cash payments to relieve economic stresses from our historic recession, and some have introduced legislation to provide them. Some of these proposals have been universal and not monthly, such as Senator Mitt Romney’s [call](https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-calls-urgent-action-additional-coronavirus-response-measures) for one-time $1,000 payments to each adult. Others have been monthly but not universal, like the [Monthly Economic Crisis and Support Act](https://static.politico.com/ea/52/4e9d51534400b64f3a5fa40aabfd/gai20332-4.pdf) from Senators Harris, Sanders, and Markey, which provides payments of $2,000 per person per month, phasing out for high-income households. However, universal monthly payments have been proposed by Senator [Bernie Sanders](https://berniesanders.com/issues/emergency-response-coronavirus-pandemic/) and Representatives [Justin Amash](https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/1242486422180855815), [Rashida Tlaib](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6553) (and 11 cosponsors), [Ilhan Omar](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6290/cosponsors?searchResultViewType=expanded) (and 4 cosponsors), and [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/897).


### Broihier’s ambitious UBI is part of wide-ranging fiscal reform

Once the Covid-19 crisis ends, Broihier [proposes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kiBlfBFx7UBdgORWqRgKUt8r6EDzVc8LcqB8-072aJU/edit) transitioning the emergency UBI into a smaller permanent one: monthly payments of $1,200 per adult and $400 per child. This targets bringing everyone above the official poverty measure, with a buffer to pay new taxes funding the UBI. It would cost $330 billion per month — $4 trillion per year, or about a fifth of GDP.


![Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang endorsed Mike Broihier in the Kentucky Senate race](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yQFu4mq_inMH1x2VlimJqA.png)

The primary funding sources would be a 10 percent value added tax (VAT) and the elimination of all tax deductions and credits, including the standard deduction. A 10 percent VAT would raise about [$1 trillion per year](https://taxfoundation.org/andrew-yang-value-added-tax-universal-basic-income/), and Broihier estimates that eliminating all deductions and credits would raise about $1.5 trillion per year.

Some of the cost would also be offset by counting the UBI as income against means-tested benefit eligibility, and eliminating Temporary Aid for Needy Families (which now only gives about [a quarter of its funds](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-welfare-dollars-dont-go-directly-to-poor-people-anymore/) as cash).

To reduce the deficit impact over time, Broihier proposes taxing public US companies based on their market capitalization: 3 percent upon IPO, merger, or acquisition, and another 0.5 percent per year. The tax would be paid in stock rather than cash, creating a [social wealth fund](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/projects/social-wealth-fund) that bears interest for future public spending.

Finally, Broihier proposes eliminating the income cap on payroll taxes, while also lowering rates from 6.2 percent to 4 percent on both employers and employees. Social Security benefits would not change.

On top of the $1,200/$400 UBI, Broihier would institute a carbon fee-and-dividend, where each metric ton of carbon emissions is priced at $40 — rising $15 per year — and the proceeds are shared equally with Americans. As he notes, [over 3,300 economists](https://www.econstatement.org/) support the carbon fee-and-dividend model as an effective and equitable climate change tool, including many who have held top government positions. There are also a number of carbon fee-and-dividend bills in Congress, including the [Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act](https://energyinnovationact.org/), which has 81 co-sponsors and a similar structure to Broihier’s plan.


### Patel’s generous child allowance


![NY-12 House candidate Suraj Patel worked on President Obama’s campaigns and in the Obama White House](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*A_oNHmFPtRk8X760pLjIDQ.png)

As part of his [Family Opportunity Guarantee](https://www.surajpatel.nyc/new-page), Suraj Patel proposes replacing the Child Tax Credit (CTC) with “a Universal Child Dividend of $500 per kid, per month ages 0–5; $350 per kid, per month ages 6–17.” The Universal Child Dividend would cost about $360 billion per year, or $240 billion after [replacing the CTC](https://www.pgpf.org/budget-basics/what-is-the-child-tax-credit).

Patel appears to have modeled this after the American Family Act (AFA), Senator Michael Bennet’s plan to make the CTC fully available to low-income families, increase the amount (with a bonus for young children), and distribute it monthly rather than annually. Specifically, it makes the credit “fully refundable,” meaning the entirety of it is provided to families that don’t owe net federal taxes. As I [wrote in 2018](https://medium.com/@MaxGhenis/we-should-replace-the-child-tax-credit-with-a-universal-child-benefit-33773de07271), even a budget-neutral replacement of the Child Tax Credit with a child allowance would cut child poverty by 15 percent, since the CTC’s non-refundable component excludes our poorest kids.

The AFA would boost the up-to-$2,000 CTC to $3,000 per child aged 6 to 16 and $3,600 per child under 6. It’s been estimated to [cut child poverty by 42 percent](https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/news-internal/2019/3/5/the-afa-and-child-poverty), and is co-sponsored by most Democrats in both the [Senate](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/690/related-bills) and [House](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1560).

Indeed, Patel claims, “The Universal Child Dividend alone will slash child poverty in half,” which seems like a conservative estimate given the payments would be about 50 percent larger than the AFA.


### These plans would be progressive

In lieu of a full distributional analysis, we can learn from other analyses of similar plans. For example, my analysis of Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend found that it would be [highly progressive](https://medium.com/ubicenter/distributional-analysis-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d8dab818bf1b), despite the slightly regressive VAT structure and reduction of benefit outlays. Other analyses have found that child allowances [cut poverty substantially](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5743308460b5e922a25a6dc7/t/5c7fe48b1905f46e1214bc42/1551885452114/Poverty+%26+Social+Policy+Brief+3_3.pdf) — even [more than adult UBIs](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2018/11/29/a-child-allowance-would-be-very-effective-at-poverty-reduction/) per dollar spent. Broihier’s addition of a child allowance to Yang’s adult-only proposal, and Patel’s Universal Child Dividend, are both effective antipoverty policies that would also invest in our future.

#### The right tax filing schedule could get you thousands in (poorly designed) Recovery Rebates. And Congress: Let’s just do UBI next time.

Late Wednesday night, the Senate unanimously passed the [CARES Act](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eT-ANEEd-AgAzyQh8GVUGoRqtKRLHxDm/view), a $2.2 trillion relief package to address the Covid-19 pandemic. The House is [expected to pass it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-leaders-seek-to-expedite-emergency-aid-package-amid-uncertainty-about-gop-lawmaker-delaying-measure/2020/03/26/392c9dba-6f7d-11ea-a3ec-70d7479d83f0_story.html) on Friday.

Of all the components of the nearly-900-page bill, the Recovery Rebates will have the broadest and most tangible reach. [Over 93 percent](https://taxfoundation.org/cares-act-senate-coronavirus-bill-economic-relief-plan/) of tax filers will receive these one-time checks of up to $1,200 per adult and $500 per child.

There’s a catch, though. The amounts start phasing out for tax filers with income over $75,000 (single) or $150,000 (married), and that income comes from your latest tax filing: 2019 if you’ve filed, otherwise 2018.

Filers with lower earnings in 2020 than the year of the latest tax return (2018 or 2019) will get a credit on their 2020 tax refunds next year. But the reverse isn’t true; filers that get more from the current payment than they would have based on 2020 income [don’t have to pay it back](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/489578-questions-and-answers-on-coronavirus-relief-checks). So it’s in each filer’s interest to get as high a payment immediately as possible.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said today that the checks will start coming [in the next three weeks](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/coronavirus-stimulus-checks-will-come-within-three-weeks-mnuchin-says.html). That might mean it’s already too late, and those that haven’t filed for 2019 yet could be stuck with 2018 information. Or they might have a couple weeks. The IRS hasn’t given any information either way.


![irs.gov/coronavirus would prefer you stop calling them about your money.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*YJ8DsPnAxk6JE7Tc)

One thing’s for sure: there’s no need to worry about timing it around the normal April 15 tax day. The IRS extended the deadline to [July 15](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-day-now-july-15-treasury-irs-extend-filing-deadline-and-federal-tax-payments-regardless-of-amount-owed).

That’s it on the PSA for maximizing the recovery rebate. If you’re interested in how to avoid poor policy design like this in the future, read on.


### This is why you don’t means-test emergency relief money

There’s no good way to means-test outside the tax system. SNAP (food stamps), TANF (welfare), and Medicaid restrict to low-income households through an onerous process often involving in-person interviews, mandatory contact each time a recipient’s income change, and regular recertification of work/work-seeking and other circumstances. Unemployment insurance, currently facing stresses keeping up with new volume, also requires in-depth interactions. All these programs differ by state, or even by county, and a bunch of other small programs like discounted transit often just condition on SNAP receipt.

There’s *especially *no good way to means-test in the middle of an emergency, when Washington wants to help most of the country afford basic necessities in a matter of weeks. There’s no time or resources for anything like the SNAP process, and nationwide consistency is an essential ingredient for quick passage through Congress.

Using old tax data is the only way, and doing so doesn’t only penalize people for either filing too early or too late. What if a person got married or divorced since their last tax filing? Or had a child, or had a child age out of their household? Or even more complicated, if they got divorced and remarried? The IRS is going to have to make some tough calls to figure this out, and they’ll make mistakes that will force exes to figure out how to split the new money. And then what about the reconciliation in next year’s taxes?

Using taxes also means sending money by tax filing unit, which can create hidden discrepancies. For example, the Recovery Rebate only gives money for primary filers and child dependents. If someone claims a college-age child on taxes, or other adult dependents like an elderly parent or someone with a disability, [they get $0](https://medium.com/whatever-source-derived/dont-exclude-elderly-and-disabled-dependents-from-covid-19-aid-54fc59eb43f3) to help them through this crisis.

All this effort, cost, and complexity cannot possibly be worth a bit of savings from excluding the top 7 percent of households.

Instead, we should just give to everyone. Suppose we gave the $1,200 to every adult and $500 to every child. Based on the [current population](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/demo/p25-1146.pdf), that’d cost $348 billion, or an extra $56 billion above the [$292 billion](https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=5252) cost of the Recovery Rebates. That’s about 2.5 percent of the total CARES Act.

If we want to, we can effectively tax that money back next year. But even if we don’t, we can expect high income people to lose a larger dollar amount than other groups, based on past recessions. More progressive taxation is a fine way to save money — and we’ll surely need more taxes to pay off the relief costs once this is all over — but either way, most rich people will lose far more income than the couple grand they’ll get in rebates.


![Source: Congressional Budget Office. “The Distribution of Household Income, 2016.”](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*UqUNf-sBuJMzJLs6)

Some of this will still be slowed by transaction time. The Treasury will have to spend more effort reaching people without recent tax records, or without existing direct deposit for receiving tax refunds. We could speed this up in the future by offering everyone government bank accounts, or connecting them with direct deposit or debit cards like Social Security does. Other forms of universal transfers — even small ones like a [carbon dividend](http://energyinnovationact.org) or a [child allowance](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/3/6/18249290/child-poverty-american-family-act-sherrod-brown-michael-bennet) — would create payment infrastructure that could be jacked up in times of need.

It might not be so long before this choice rears its head again. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she’s [considering more cash payments](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/489587-pelosi-democrats-eyeing-more-cash-payments-in-next-emergency-bill) in the next relief bill. She should join the eight congresspeople from both parties who have [called for making them universal](https://medium.com/ubicenter/tracking-us-emergency-cash-transfer-proposals-7c4bf90e8ac8). Crises are not the time for convoluted means-tests.

## What we learned about basic income in 2019

### What we learned about basic income in 2019


#### The research frontier expanded rapidly

2019 has been a big year for universal basic income (UBI). Web searches for the topic rose over 40 percent since 2018 in the US, and over 130 percent globally. A 2019 Nobel laureate wrote a paper on [UBI in the developing world](https://economics.mit.edu/files/16000), the World Bank published a book of [UBI evidence](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/00XEDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0), and Palgrave Macmillan published the [fifteenth](https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783030143770) and [sixteenth](https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783030236137) books in their [academic series on UBI](https://www.palgrave.com/gp/series/14981).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*wcBsSjvTzsPhBZiz)

This post reviews a slice of the UBI-related research that came out this year. It begins with evaluations of UBI programs and experiments, then considers simulations of UBI policy, followed by studies of related programs like cash transfers, and finally how the public feels about UBI and cash transfers (and what affects those sentiments).


### UBI programs

A number of new studies came out on the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD), which pays residents between $1,000 and $3,000 per year from returns on oil wealth. Guettabi’s [review](https://scholarworks.alaska.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11122/10581/2019_05_20-EffectsOfAKPFD.pdf?sequence=1) of research to date summarizes the null effect on employment, positive effects on birthweight and consumption of non-durable goods (e.g. food, not cars) and services, and reductions of childhood obesity and poverty; the review also showed increased income inequality. Feinberg and Keuhn found that [entrepreneurship rose](https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=IIOC2019&paper_id=40) after the PFD’s introduction, though the effect faded. The PFD increased [substance abuse](https://pubs.iseralaska.org/media/7c5b42d2-02b3-46dc-8221-5d32776ec51f/Universal_Cash_and_Crime.pdf) incidents, had no effect on violent crime, and reduced property crime (Watson et al; [Dorsett](https://www.westminster.ac.uk/sites/default/public-files/general-documents/WPS%202019_02_Dorsett%20R.pdf) also found reduced property crime, but only when the PFD payouts were large). Lerner found no detectable effect of the PFD on [high school completion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.04083.pdf). Mahdavi goes back to the PFD’s introduction in 1976, finding that receiving the PFD just before an election [reduces voter turnout](http://www.paashamahdavi.com/LBP-aug2019.pdf) compared to receiving it just afterwards.

[Finland’s UBI experiment](http://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/161361/Report_The%20Basic%20Income%20Experiment%2020172018%20in%20Finland.pdf) had no effect on employment, but significantly improved each of 14 questions asked about well-being, from trust to confidence to health, and raised appetite for UBI. The Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED) launched a [dashboard](https://seed.sworps.tennessee.edu/employment.html) characterizing the recipients and comparison groups, but no experiment results yet.


### Simulations

Hoynes and Rothstein [argued](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25538) in February that “UBI pilot studies will do little to resolve the major outstanding questions,” and that design questions — for example, how it’s funded and what it replaces — deserve more attention. Researchers started to answer that call throughout the year, simulating full UBIs, UBIs for children, and smaller UBIs funded by fees on carbon emissions.


#### UBI simulations

Multiple researchers, myself included, simulated presidential candidate Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend, a UBI of $1,000 per month per adult funded by a 10 percent VAT and other sources. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that a 10 percent VAT [would be insufficient](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/would-10-vat-pay-1000-month-ubi) to fund a $1,000 UBI. I too found that Yang’s plan would add to the deficit, though it would [dramatically reduce poverty and inequality](https://medium.com/ubicenter/distributional-analysis-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d8dab818bf1b). I also simulated a [budget-neutral version](https://medium.com/ubicenter/a-revenue-neutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d7d517dbeeea) of the plan (closer to $500 per month), which would still be distributionally progressive, and found that the citizenship limitation is the [main reason](https://medium.com/ubicenter/why-some-low-income-people-come-out-behind-in-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-c95d0f1cc433) some low-income people are left worse off. Pomerleau found that [raising the VAT to 22 percent and reducing the amount to $750](https://taxfoundation.org/andrew-yang-value-added-tax) would make it budget-neutral. [UBI Calculator](https://ubicalculator.com/) was released, showing that Yang’s plan would add to the deficit but benefit most citizens, especially low-income ones.

Katz and Sarel simulated a [UBI in Israel](https://euiha41fnsb2lyeld3vkc37i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Basic-Income-in-Israel.pdf) funded by (a) higher income taxes and (b) ending welfare programs and tax benefits. Their plan provided monthly amounts between $340 and $930 per adult, with amount rising with age, and between $40 and $190 per child, depending on the child’s birth number in the family. They found that this plan would reduce inequality and improve work incentives.


![Katz and Sarel (2019): Basic Income in Israel](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*7x4J9F4n_Fx_T0Vy)

Lansley and Reed modeled [two versions of a UBI for the UK](https://www.compassonline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Compass_BasicIncomeForAll_2019.pdf): one funded by tax and benefit changes, and the other funded by a social wealth fund. They find that “a basic income even at modest levels would be highly progressive, reduce poverty and inequality, and cut dependency on means testing.”


![Lansley and Reed (2019): Basic Income for All: From Desirability to Feasibility](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*3_Br0rWmqJRGAHAc)

Plá et al found that [replacing Spain’s existing benefit system](https://www.euromod.ac.uk/sites/default/files/working-papers/em8-19.pdf) with a budget-neutral UBI would be modestly regressive, and Gentilini and Rigolini [found the same](http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/103921528839429277/SSN-Day8-1pm-Ugo-UBI.pdf) with respect to Russia and Brazil.

Colombino reviewed [10 simulation studies](https://wol.iza.org/articles/is-unconditional-basic-income-viable-alternative-to-other-social-welfare-measures/long) of UBI and negative income taxes (NITs) from multiple countries (as well as 11 non-simulation studies), finding:


> When the evaluation criterion goes beyond labor supply effects (e.g. takes into account the effects on inequality and on the values of non-market activities), NIT and UBI in most cases turn out to be superior to the current systems.


#### Child allowance simulations

Child allowances are UBIs for children; they exist in some form in many countries, and the US has considered reforms to create one.

The most significant US child assistance proposal is the American Family Act (AFA), which would reform the Child Tax Credit to eliminate the phase-in and increase the amount. This would create a near-child allowance, excluding only high earners. [Collyer et al](https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/news-internal/2019/3/5/the-afa-and-child-poverty) found “that the AFA would move 4 million children out of poverty and cut deep poverty among children in half,” with the phase-in removal being particularly important for poverty reduction. Hammond and Orr arrive at a [similar conclusion](https://www.expandthechildtaxcredit.com/the-american-family-act), while also finding that the AFA would reduce adult poverty by 10 percent and that its average benefit would be higher for non-white families.

Wunder found that a [$9,330 annual child allowance](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00213624.2019.1603769) would reduce US child poverty by 75 percent, and CANCEA found that [Canada would have 588,000 more children in poverty](https://ubiworks.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Economic-Contribution-of-the-Canada-Child-Benefit.pdf) if not for their Child Benefit.


#### Carbon dividend simulations

Carbon dividends are carbon fees whose revenue is distributed as an unconditional cash transfer, i.e. as a (small) UBI. Several carbon pricing bills are in the US Congress, but only one fully rebates the revenue as a UBI: the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (EICDA).

Kaufman et al found that the EICDA would reduce emissions and air pollution, and also would be [highly progressive](https://energypolicy.columbia.edu/research/report/assessment-energy-innovation-and-carbon-dividend-act). Hafstead found that the EICDA would be a [net financial gain](https://www.rff.org/cpc/) for the bottom three quintiles (on average) and reduce annual emissions by 53 percent by 2035, though it would also reduce GDP by 2.5 percent by 2035.

#### GiveDirectly cash transfers

[GiveDirectly](http://givedirectly.org) is a charity that provides unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) to extremely poor families, mostly in East Africa. They were founded by economists and continue to study the effect of their work in randomized controlled trials.

Their most newsworthy paper, released in December, examined the general equilibrium effects of their transfers. In this experiment, entire villages were treated, with transfers restricted to low-income households. Egger et al found that [non-recipients also benefited](http://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/assets/miguel_research/88/GE-Paper_2019-12-18.pdf): households receiving the transfers saw consumption rise, but so did households in the same village who didn’t get the money — and their consumption rose a similar amount. Each dollar of cash transfers grew the local economy by $2.60.

Other studies also found substantial benefits from the GiveDirectly UCTs. Haushofer et al found that [UCTs reduce intimate partner violence](https://www.princeton.edu/~joha/publications/Haushofer_Ringdal_Shapiro_Wang_IPV_2019-07-13_jh.pdf), with larger benefits when given to women; like Egger, they find spillovers, with violence toward non-recipient women in treated villages falling nearly as much as for recipient women. In another paper, Haushofer et al found that UCTs [worsen psychological well-being for non-recipients](https://www.princeton.edu/~joha/publications/Haushofer_Reisinger_Shapiro_Inequality_2019.pdf). Finally, Cooke et al find [significant increases in consumption and revenue](https://www.givedirectly.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cash_Crop_Ugandan_CoffeeRCT.pdf) for coffee farmer recipients of GiveDirectly UCTs.

GiveDirectly will release results from their universal basic income experiment next year; the 2019 Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee is researching it. They also published a [guide to UBI](https://www.givedirectly.org/basic-income/) this year, which includes relevant academic research and their planned contribution.


#### Other cash transfers

Carneiro et al found that [providing extremely poor Nigerian families UCTs](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~uctpimr/research/CDGP.pdf) from pregnancy until the child turned 2, combined with pre- and neo-natal information, reduced children’s stunting by 8 percent.

Tracing Mexican families 20 years after their receipt of a conditional cash transfer (CCT), Aguilar et al found [positive effects](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/423621568052375850/pdf/Long-Term-Effects-of-PROSPERA-on-Welfare.pdf) on household formation, migration, durable assets, consumption expenditures and food security, and intergenerational mobility.

Baird et al evaluated a [two-year CCT-UCT experiment](https://gps.ucsd.edu/_files/faculty/mcintosh/mcintosh_research_when-the-money-runs-out.pdf) for adolescent females in Malawi, finding that the CCT caused sustained improvements on education and fertility (having children when they want to). While the UCT did not cause sustained benefits among recipients, it improved fertility and reduced HIV infections in the short term, and improved health of the recipients’ children.

Daidone et al reviewed evaluations of [government cash transfer programs in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa](https://academic.oup.com/ajae/article/101/5/1401/5420281), which show consistently positive effects on consumption and moving workers from casual agricultural wage labor to more productive work on family farms or elsewhere, though other effects varied by country.


#### Universality and unconditionality

New research compares the traditional means testing and requirements to the universality and unconditionality of UBI.

Kidd and Athias examined [38 programs across 23 low- and middle-income countries](https://www.developmentpathways.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Hit-and-Miss-March13-1.pdf), finding that the four universal programs were significantly more effective at reaching the poor than means-tested programs, mistakenly excluding under 10 percent of its intended audience, compared to exclusion errors above 50 percent in most means-tested programs.

ILO and UNICEF published a report [advocating universal child grants](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/wcms_669336.pdf) across countries as a tool of meeting the UN’s goal of ending global poverty.

Neuert et al reviewed the behavioral economics literature in their paper, [Work Requirements Don’t Work](https://www.ideas42.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ideas42-Work-Requirements-Paper.pdf). Harris studied the [US SNAP program](https://research.upjohn.org/up_workingpapers/297/) (food stamps) specifically, finding that “work requirements significantly decreased SNAP participation and marginally increased employment for ABAWD [Able-Bodied Adults without Dependents].”


### Sentiment

In the US, a Hill-HarrisX poll found [rising support](https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/463055-more-voters-support-universal-basic-income) for a $1,000 per month UBI to help Americans whose jobs are threatened by automation, from 43 percent in February to 49 percent in September; it is especially popular with voters under age 35 and Democrats. Echelon Insights [asked voters](http://echeloninsights.com/wp-content/uploads/Omnibus-June-2019_Policies.pdf) about UBI without the automation framing, emphasizing its unconditionality, and found that 40 percent supported it; they too found higher support among Democrats and young people, as well as those with lower incomes.

The late Alan Krueger conducted a [survey experiment](https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/evidence-base/what-do-americans-think-about-universal-basic-income/), asking Americans whether they support (a) a UBI in the US, and (b) a UBI in poor parts of Africa, randomizing the order of (a) and (b). Respondents who were asked first about UBI in Africa were more favorable to UBI in the US, and those who were asked first about UBI in the US were less favorable to UBI in Africa.

Stadelmann-Steffen and Dermont identified [greater UBI support in Finland](https://boris.unibe.ch/135192/1/JSP-StadelmannSteffenDermont2019.pdf) than in Switzerland, with people in both countries favoring UBIs that are (a) more generous, and (b) restricted to citizens.

Reminiscently of both Krueger’s survey experiment and Mahdavi’s PFD paper, Mosec and Mo conducted a [survey experiment in Pakistan](http://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/133270/filename/133484.pdf), finding that cash transfers increase support for political leaders and institutions only when they are primed to think of inequality (salience of inequality also reduces political support among those denied cash transfers). Similarly, Zucco et al conducted [survey experiments in Brazil and Turkey](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220388.2019.1577388) finding that “conditional transfers are only marginally more popular than similar unconditional transfers in nationally representative samples, but that this difference is substantially larger among the better-off and among those primed to think of themselves as different from beneficiaries.” Finally, Rios et al [also show](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/disa.12378) that “residents of Fiji who received a post‐disaster cash transfer are up to 20 per cent more likely to be very satisfied with the government than are those who did not.”

What are some common threads from UBI research in 2019? New evidence from Alaska, Finland, and developing countries find that UBIs and cash transfers have generally similar effects: positive effects on consumption and children’s health, and on incomes in developing countries. UCTs in Kenya had positive economic spillovers but negative psychological spillovers, which may also be evident in Pakistan. Simulated UBIs were regressive when only replacing means-tested programs, but progressive when other funding sources were included, and various studies found that universal transfers can better reach the poor. Finally, UBI appears to be getting more popular, though its reception varies by country and framing.

The most important evidence on UBI in 2020 may come from GiveDirectly’s UBI experiment in Kenya, which is randomized by village and guarantees recipients transfers for up to 12 years. But if it’s anything like 2019, we’ll have much more research to look forward to, as well.

### Why I’ve taken the Giving What We Can pledge


#### The global poor will benefit much more from ten percent of my income than I will

**TL;DR:*** I’m pledging to give at least ten percent of my income to highly effective charities from 2019 on. For this year, I’m giving mostly to *[GiveDirectly](http://givedirectly.org)* (which provides direct cash transfers to extremely poor households) and *[GiveWell](http://givewell.org)* (which directs donations quarterly *[at its discretion](https://www.givewell.org/about/FAQ/discretionary-grantmaking)*, generally to life-saving treatments like malaria bed nets). To join me and the *[over 4,400 members](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/members/)* of *[Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/)*, visit *[givingwhatwecan.org/pledge](http://givingwhatwecan.org/pledge)*.*

When I was about 12, I sat around the dining room table with my family, paging through the catalog of the charity *Heifer International*.* *We were looking for the best animal to buy for a poor farmer in sub-Saharan Africa. We felt warm and fuzzy as we settled on a goat, knowing we were helping someone with far less than we’d ever had. While we’d given to homeless people and local services before, the Heifer catalog is my first salient memory of giving.

Once I started working after college, I was glad for the chance to give my own money to charities. Heifer now seemed prescriptive and arbitrary to me (why would I know the best livestock to get a farmer?),¹ so I focused on medical research and interest-free Kiva loans to poor people looking for business investment in developing countries.² My intuitions were that medical advancements served the public good, and that people in poorer countries who sought funding for a specific venture would benefit most from a dollar of giving. But I wondered whether these choices were the best use of my giving budget.

I started to satisfy this curiosity in 2012, when I learned of [GiveDirectly](http://givedirectly.org), a small nonprofit that gave direct, unconditional cash transfers to extremely poor families in Kenya. Their approach was novel but not untested: other studies had shown that giving people cash improved outcomes ranging from nutrition to business investment, and GiveDirectly (founded by economists) was evaluating its own disbursements with randomized controlled trials. GiveDirectly’s focus on efficiency (90 cents of every dollar in donations ended up in the hands of a poor person), transparent measurement, and effective deployment of additional funds, earned it a [“Top Charity”](https://web.archive.org/web/20121201034608/http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly) rating from the evidence-based evaluator [GiveWell](http://givewell.org). GiveWell evaluates charities on the cost-effectiveness of their measured impact, and awarded only three Top Charity ratings in 2012.


![GiveWell’s logo as of 2012 (they’ve since scrapped the slogan)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*uBygJagB-WFaixZG)

Discovering GiveDirectly — and GiveWell’s review of GiveDirectly — became a seminal event in my life. My interest in cash transfers led to researching [universal basic income](http://ubicenter.org) (UBI, which GiveDirectly is [testing](https://www.givedirectly.org/ubi-study/) in Kenya), while the validation of GiveWell’s evaluation contributed to my decision to pursue a [master’s degree](http://economics.mit.edu/masters) in development economics, which I’ll start next month (the program was created by one of the researchers evaluating GiveDirectly’s UBI experiment, who just [won](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2019/10/press-economicsciences2019.pdf) the Nobel Prize).

These organizations have continued to grow and improve. GiveDirectly still gives lump-sum transfers to Kenyans living on a dollar a day, and now operates in [seven](https://www.givedirectly.org/faq/) more countries while distributing in new ways: as [UBI](https://www.givedirectly.org/ubi-study/), to [disaster victims](https://www.givedirectly.org/relief/) and [refugees](https://www.givedirectly.org/refugees/), and as a [benchmark](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/9/13/17846190/cash-saves-lives-rwanda-usaid-foreign-aid-nutrition) for other aid organizations to test their interventions. They’ve completed a number of randomized controlled trial [evaluations](https://www.givedirectly.org/research-at-give-directly/), revealing that recipients have higher earnings, assets, and nutrition spend, without increases to alcohol and tobacco spend. Their [latest study](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/11/25/20973151/givedirectly-basic-income-kenya-study-stimulus) even finds benefits among non-recipients: households receiving the transfers saw consumption rise, but so did households in the same village who didn’t get the money — and their consumption rose a similar amount.

GiveWell has updated their list of [top charities](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities/) annually, including GiveDirectly each year, along with charities that treat and prevent fatal or debilitating diseases. These other charities are extremely cost-effective at averting deaths — for example, they estimate that the Against Malaria Foundation does so for [$2,300](https://twitter.com/MaxGhenis/status/1210456968701177856) — and boosting consumption among those on the verge of starvation.

I didn’t know all this over the past seven years — some wasn’t yet knowable — but I became increasingly convinced that giving effectively was one of the most important things I could do. So over time, I increased my giving³ and shifted it toward GiveDirectly and other top GiveWell charities.

### Effective Altruism

Over this period, I also learned more about the *effective altruism *(EA) movement. EA began with global development in mind, making GiveWell a sort of standard-bearer. It’s since expanded into charities promoting animal welfare and reducing the risk of massive disasters — e.g. by improving the safety of artificial intelligence systems and nuclear arsenals, and preparing for pandemics — and supporting individuals seeking to dedicate their careers to these issues rather than only donating to them.

EA forces donors to confront some difficult moral questions, like how to weigh saving someone from blindness against saving a child from dying of malaria. Or harder yet, how to weigh these short-term gains against making human extinction a tiny bit less likely.

But one moral question was less ambiguous: whether someone living a relatively comfortable life in a rich country should give generously to effective causes. The philosopher Peter Singer illustrates this with a [thought experiment](https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm). In it, you are walking by a pond and notice a child drowning. Should you save them, even if doing so would ruin your clothes and shoes? “Of course,” most would say. Do you not, then, have the same obligation to save children across the world from us, when it comes at a similarly low cost?

[Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) is an EA organization created to commit people to this line of reasoning. Those who take its pledge are committing to give at least ten percent of their income to highly effective charities each year (with [exceptions or adaptations](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/frequently-asked-questions/#45-what-about-students--the-unemployed--the-retired) for students, retirees, people with health conditions, etc.). Here’s the text of the Pledge:


> I recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant amount of good. Since I can live well enough on a smaller income, I pledge that for the rest of my life or until the day I retire, I shall give at least ten percent of what I earn to whichever organisations can most effectively use it to improve the lives of others, now and in the years to come. I make this pledge freely, openly, and sincerely.

Someone earning the US median personal income of [$33,706](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEPAINUSA672N) — placing them in the [richest 3.7 percent](https://howrichami.givingwhatwecan.org/?income=33706&countryCode=USA&household%5Badults%5D=1&household%5Bchildren%5D=0) of the global population — would then be saving about 1.5 lives per year by giving their pledged amount to the Against Malaria Foundation.

I’ve known of the Giving What We Can pledge for a few years, but finally pulled the trigger for a couple reasons. One, I’ve simply learned more about the horrific scale of global poverty, and the tractability of ending it. While a number of resources have made an impact on me — such as the website [Our World In Data](http://ourworldindata.org), Vox’s [Future Perfect](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect) project, and various posts on the [EA forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/) — the most recent educational source has been Peter Singer’s book, [The Life You Can Save](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/)*.*⁴* *Originally published in 2009, Singer [re-released it for free](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/the-book/) this month in e-book and audiobook formats. I finally read it, checking off a book long on my list, and was more convinced than ever of the moral and empirical case for giving generously.

There’s also the question of [when to give](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/frequently-asked-questions/#24-why-give-now-rather-than-later-in-life-or-in-my-will). I initially wanted to save more before committing to give a larger share of my income, but newer research found that my money would do much more good early on than later. For example, GiveDirectly transfers yield rates of return of [30 percent or more](https://www.givedirectly.org/research-on-cash-transfers/) among recipients, because their businesses are so capital-constrained, far outweighing the 8 percent or so my money earns in stock index funds. And since these countries are developing economically, health interventions that save lives today will probably not be available for such low cost in the future. At a certain point, all the easy-to-reach households will have malaria bed nets, and it’ll be harder to find similarly cheap ways to save lives; it might be a while before it costs millions to save a life as it does in the US, but they’ll progress quickly, and the sooner effective charities can invest in the low-hanging fruit, the more deaths my money can avert.

Finally, *The Life You Can Save* reviews the evidence on what causes people to give. It turns out that social norms are a major factor. The ten-percent tithe is common across religions and employer gift matches affect giving levels, and randomized experiments also show that people are primed by what others are giving when deciding how much to give. That’s why it wasn’t enough for me to give privately; I hope that adding my name to a [public list of pledgers](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/members/) (and writing this) encourages others to consider giving a bit more, or to charities that are more proven, or to go all-out and take the pledge.


### How I’m giving this year

At this point it may not be surprising that I’m giving to GiveWell and GiveDirectly: I’m giving each of them five percent of my 2019 income.


![Source: GiveWell](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*gfFnubfm7wPVNeZI)

[GiveWell](http://givewell.org) allocates their donations quarterly to one or two of their [top charities](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities). I expect that they’ll give to an organization that will save or improve a great number of lives (probably by treating or preventing malaria or worms). I’ve given through GiveWell rather than directly to one of their top charities (e.g. Against Malaria Foundation) because (a) I trust them to make the best choice at the end of the quarter based on need and new information, and (b) doing so signals to GiveWell’s operational funders that their evaluation work is valued.

[GiveDirectly](http://givedirectly.org) will transfer about 85 percent of my donation directly to extremely poor households in sub-Saharan Africa, after transaction and distribution costs. While this might not save as many lives as Against Malaria Foundation, the recipients will see lasting economic and nutritional improvements from the transfer, and they will be fully empowered to make the best use of the money. Supporting GiveDirectly will grow their transformation of the aid sector — and even public policy sector — by emphasizing unconditional cash transfers.

In addition, I’m giving under 1 percent of my income to these two organizations. While neither is an explicitly EA charities of the GiveWell variety, I believe that they are worthy causes by virtue of their [importance, tractability, and neglectedness](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/importance-neglectedness-tractability/).

- Yes In My Back Yard (YIMBY), which makes housing more affordable and accessible through education and advocacy, as well as legal action against cities that violate state and federal housing law. Many studies show that housing shortages in urban areas are causing poverty, climate change, air pollution, homelessness, immobility, and slow economic growth (here’s a review I recently wrote). YIMBY is a 501(c)3 that works with other pro-housing groups I’ve volunteered with, including SF YIMBY and California YIMBY (and Ventura County YIMBY, the CA YIMBY chapter I co-founded) to promote more construction of dense infill homes. From an EA lens, I’m encouraged that Open Philanthropy Project, GiveWell’s sister organization, supports YIMBY groups, and has also identified immigration policy as a focus area, which abundant housing supply can promote.
- Citizens’ Climate Education, which educates the public about carbon fee-and-dividend policies. They’re the 501(c)3 arm of Citizens’ Climate Lobby, which I joined in early 2019. EAs tend not to emphasize climate change because, while it is clearly important, it’s far from neglected. However, I believe carbon pricing is worthwhile because it has greater potential to cut emissions than any other policy, and it lacks the grassroots support of other environmental organizations like the Sunrise Movement or the Sierra Club. Citizens’ Climate Lobby has organized carbon pricing advocates since 2007, and it now has a bill in Congress with 75 cosponsors.


### Until next time

I plan to do another recap like this next year, and hope it will include a new charity or two. For example, I didn’t donate to non-GiveWell EA charities like “longtermism” (AI, nuclear, and pandemic safety); meta EA (supporting organizations like Giving What We Can); or animal welfare. I don’t yet have confidence that these areas are worth diversifying away from GiveWell and GiveDirectly, but I expect that that could change with more research. Now that my stakes are higher, I’m looking forward to researching how to make my giving count even more.

**You can learn more about **[Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/)**, **[The Life You Can Save](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/)**, or **[Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/)**, or **[take the pledge](http://givingwhatwecan.org/pledge)**.**

¹ GiveWell [reviewed](https://www.givewell.org/International/charities/Heifer-Project-International) Heifer International in 2009 and determined that it did not meet its criteria for (a) publishing high-quality monitoring and evaluation reports, and (b) focusing on programs with strong evidence bases. They have found [little evidence](https://www.givewell.org/international/economic-empowerment/livestock-gift-programs) supporting livestock gift programs.

² GiveWell [reviewed](https://www.givewell.org/international-giving-marketplaces) Kiva, GlobalGiving, and other “giving marketplaces” in 2010, and expressed concern about fungibility, given projects are likely to be funded regardless of the donation. GiveWell’s “[current view](https://www.givewell.org/international/economic-empowerment/microfinance) is that microfinance is not among the best options for donors looking to accomplish as much good as possible.” Interest-free loans are equivalent to a donation equal to the market rate of return on the principal, plus expected default losses (i.e. the opportunity cost of the loan).

## Ventura county must end its unsheltered homelessness

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/ventura-county-must-end-its-unsheltered-homelessne/
**Published:** 2019-11-25
**Description:** ### Ventura County must end its unsheltered homelessness

### Ventura County must end its unsheltered homelessness


#### We need to make shelters more abundant and housing more affordable

*Yesterday concluded *[Hunger & Homelessness Awareness Week](https://hhweek.org/)*.*

“This is arguably one of the most contentious issues ever,” said Oxnard Mayor Tim Flynn about a [new 110-bed homeless shelter](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2019/11/20/oxnard-homeless-shelter-location-city-council-decision-former-salvation-army/4229839002/) on Tuesday night. Public comments from neighbors expressed concern over drug use, safety, and even insufficient parking, while homelessness advocates emphasized the need for compassion and shelter. Ultimately, Flynn joined four councilmembers in approving the shelter lease, marking a step toward addressing unsheltered homelessness in Ventura County.

We need far more decisions like these. [1,669 Ventura County residents are homeless](http://www.venturacoc.org/images/2019_VC_Homeless_Count_Report-Final.pdf), of whom 1,258 lack shelter. Those numbers increased 29 and 53 percent, respectively, over the past year.

They should be zero: Nobody in Ventura County should be forced to live on the streets or in parks without access to restrooms and medical care. As Oxnard City Manager Alex Nguyen said at Tuesday’s hearing, “This is a public health crisis.” We agree, and it should be addressed as one.


> Homelessness is a public health crisis.

With a combination of more shelters to house our homeless neighbors, more subsidies to keep at-risk families in their homes, and more homes to make housing more broadly affordable, we can end unsheltered homelessness in Ventura County. But first, the facts.


### Debunking homelessness myths

Perceptions of homelessness are often based on its most visible instances. Seeing a homeless person doing drugs in public can be shocking, and it’s not unusual to then assume that this is the norm.

Those salient occurrences are unrepresentative, however. The stereotype of a chronically homeless out-of-towner with a mental health problem abusing substances on our streets isn’t just rare in combination, it’s rare for homeless people to have even one of those characteristics.


![Ventura County 2019 Homeless Count, calculations by Ventura County YIMBY](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BalH6-s63BqA1tBxCqqdAw.png)

While three quarters of homeless people in Ventura County lack shelter, only about a quarter are new to Ventura County, have mental health or substance abuse problems, or are chronically homeless.

For the subset who do suffer from substance abuse or mental health problems, the stability of shelter is all the more important. We have the resources to help these people get the care they need, but providing that help is difficult when they sleep on a different street corner every night.


### The shelter shortage

As of January, Ventura County had 464 emergency shelter and transitional housing beds, one for every 3.6 homeless people. A new 110-bed shelter has since opened, but that still leaves over 1,000 beds just to provide one for each homeless person.

Realistically, ending unsheltered homelessness requires more beds than homeless people, since shelters aren’t always where our homeless people are (Ventura County is over 2,200 square miles), and each shelter tends to serve a specific subpopulation. For example, the 73 vacant beds were disproportionately reserved for domestic violence victims.

84 percent of beds were utilized as of the point-in-time count, so assuming the same rate moving forward, and considering the newly built and approved shelters, we need 1,300 more shelter beds to end unsheltered homelessness.


> Ventura County needs 1,300 more shelter beds to end unsheltered homelessness.

This has worked elsewhere: for example, New York City’s unsheltered homeless rate is a quarter of Ventura County’s. How did they do it? [More shelters.](https://medium.com/@josefow/nicks-action-plan-on-street-homelessness-51ddecb1ad76)


### Preventing homelessness through housing affordability

A [2018 Zillow-commissioned report](https://www.zillow.com/research/homelessness-rent-affordability-22247/) found that “homelessness rises faster where rent exceeds a third of income.”


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*iboTeWseZoifCPn5)

While half of U.S. households spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent, 3 in 5 Ventura County households do.


![US Census Bureau, calculations by Ventura County YIMBY](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*g-M-CU2gPdp6sSht)

To cut households’ risk of homelessness, we need to boost incomes and/or reduce rents. Achieving the former can mean promoting economic development to raise wages, or providing subsidies or cash transfers to low-income renters.

[Evidence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/Housing_Development_Toolkit%20f.2.pdf) [increasingly](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3345#More_Private_Home_Building_Could_Help) [shows](https://research.upjohn.org/up_workingpapers/307/) that achieving the latter — lower rents — requires [building](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/7fc2bf_ee1737c3c9d4468881bf1434814a6f8f.pdf) [more](https://appam.confex.com/appam/2018/webprogram/Paper25811.html) [housing](https://www.sightline.org/2017/09/21/yes-you-can-build-your-way-to-affordable-housing/). This is especially important in Ventura County, which has 20 percent fewer [housing units per adult](https://medium.com/vcyimby/support-for-oxnard-fishermans-wharf-development-26d5204e9f7c) than the nation, and a 30 percent lower [rental vacancy rate](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=united%20states%20housing&lastDisplayedRow=159&table=DP04&tid=ACSDP1Y2018.DP04&t=Housing&g=0100000US_0400000US06_0500000US06111_1600000US0654652&hidePreview=true&moe=false). With abundant housing of all sorts, low-income households won’t have to compete with higher-income households for insufficient housing stock — under threat of homelessness if they don’t win — and formerly homeless people will have an easier time re-entering permanent housing.

We need a more humane approach to homelessness. Instead of rounding up tent dwellers as they move from one park to the next, let’s build shelters for them to live in. Instead of assuming the worst in each homeless person, let’s recognize that they are largely our neighbors who could no longer afford rent. Let’s build an affordable, inclusive Ventura County where unsheltered homelessness is a thing of the past.

*If you believe in this approach to homelessness, consider joining *[Ventura County YIMBY](http://vcyimby.org)* and other pro-homeless organizations in the area.*

## Warren’s wealth tax would raise less than she claims — even using her economists’ own assumptions

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/warrens-wealth-tax-would-raise-less-than-she-claim/
**Published:** 2019-11-09
**Description:** ### Warren’s wealth tax would raise less than she claims — even using her economists’ own assumptions

### Warren’s wealth tax would raise less than she claims — even using her economists’ own assumptions


#### Using their cited assumptions around avoidance and economic growth cuts revenue by a quarter

In January, Elizabeth Warren [proposed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/24/elizabeth-warren-propose-new-wealth-tax-very-rich-americans-economist-says) a two percent (“two cent”) [wealth tax](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax) on families worth $50 million or more, graduated to three percent for those worth $1 billion or more. Last Friday, she [announced](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/paying-for-m4a) an additional three percent tax on billionaires as part of her Medicare for All plan.

Warren’s plans rely on revenue from this wealth tax. It’s how she would fund student debt cancellation, tuition-free public college, teacher pay hikes, subsidized child care, and now, part of single-payer healthcare.

Her campaign has cited a $2.75 trillion 10-year revenue estimate for her original two- to three-percent tax, and estimated that the three percent Medicare for All surtax on billionaires would raise another $1 trillion. These estimates come from UC Berkeley professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who [produced](https://elizabethwarren.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/saez-zucman-wealthtax-warren-v5-web.pdf) them in three steps:

- Assemble a consolidated wealth dataset from government surveys and Forbes
- Calculate avoidance and evasion based on academic studies
- Extrapolate over a decade based on government economic growth projections

Saez and Zucman have laudably made the data from Step 1 openly accessible. In Steps 2 and 3, however, they deviated from their cited research methodology in ways that significantly inflated the revenue estimates. I [estimate](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ge5a-0yZmC7NhYjc517-koQvovFSEEnS) that addressing these issues would reduce the revenue by a quarter, nearly eliminating the Medicare for All revenue.


### Discrepancies among Saez and Zucman’s own estimates

When Warren announced her first wealth tax, Saez and Zucman published [wealthtaxsimulator.org](http://wealthtaxsimulator.org/) (WTS), where anyone could estimate the revenue from a wealth tax using the same methodology. They also released another calculator last month at [taxjusticenow.org](http://taxjusticenow.org) (TJN), along with their book, *The Triumph of Injustice*. When economists Simon Johnson, Betsey Stevenson, and Mark Zandi [scored](https://assets.ctfassets.net/4ubxbgy9463z/27ao9rfB6MbQgGmaXK4eGc/d06d5a224665324432c6155199afe0bf/Medicare_for_All_Revenue_Letter___Appendix.pdf) Warren’s Medicare for All funding proposal, they used TJN for the wealth tax.

These three sources — the Warren campaign paper and the two calculators — produce different estimates. In the Warren campaign paper, this can be partly attributed to intermediate rounding, though the two calculators also differ when entering the same tax parameters, indicating differences in the underlying data.

One large difference is that TJN shows Warren’s new three-percent billionaire surtax to raise $1.08 trillion, 27 percent more than the WTS estimate; TJN’s estimates 10 percent more total revenue than WTS for the base plus Medicare for All taxes. Since only the WTS data was made available to researchers, I used that for my analysis.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*VTasmc5meB2EPKhl)


### Does the tax rate affect avoidance?

Saez and Zucman estimate that people will understate their wealth holdings by 15 percent, based on a survey of four studies on avoidance and evasion:


> Our 15% tax avoidance/evasion response to a 2% wealth tax is based on the average across these four studies (2%*(.5+.5+2.5+28.5)/4=16%).

These studies did not estimate a single avoidance rate, but rather an *elasticity* of avoidance with respect to the tax rate. The average elasticity is 8, which they multiply by two percent to arrive at 16 percent. In reality, the formula to translate elasticity to avoidance is [more complicated](https://twitter.com/wwwojtekk/status/1190768770043789312) than multiplication; coincidentally, an elasticity of 8 with a two percent tax translates to the 15 percent avoidance they rounded to.

Warren’s wealth tax was never a flat two percent rate. Assuming that billionaires would expend the same effort to avoid a three — now six — percent tax as they would to a two percent tax is neither sensible, nor supported by the evidence cited by Saez and Zucman. Based on their elasticity, a three percent tax would cause 21 percent avoidance, and a six percent tax would cause 38 percent avoidance.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*UsSe9LGBMOqijfmJ)

Warren’s total base + Medicare for All wealth tax raises 19 percent less revenue with these higher avoidance rates. The Medicare for All component raises 65 percent less revenue, falling to $300 billion.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ZBcpUtbO5uW6bJ7T)


### Ten-year projections do not match government agencies

Saez and Zucman also inflate their estimate when extrapolating one-year estimates over a decade.

In their original Warren campaign paper, they say:


> To project tax revenues over a 10-year horizon, we assume that nominal taxable wealth would grow at the same pace as the economy, at 5.5% per year as in standard projections of the Congressional Budget Office or the Joint Committee on Taxation.

This is incorrect. In its [latest budget outlook](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-08/55551-CBO-outlook-update_0.pdf), the CBO projected a 3.8 percent average annual rate of nominal GDP increase from 2019 to 2029, and these projections are [used](https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=5163) by the Joint Committee on Taxation.

Using the CBO’s 3.8 percent growth rate instead reduces the ten-year projection by an additional 8 percent.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*YGgVbNDxdRqTDgTx)

Warren’s final proposal of a two percent tax on wealth above $50 million and six percent tax on wealth above $1 billion would now raise $2.6 trillion. Adding in the unexplained 10 percent boost from Saez and Zucman’s new calculator brings that to $2.9 trillion.

That’s $850 billion missing — a quarter of the $3.75 trillion projection — even before considering how Saez and Zucman may be [overestimating wealth](http://ericzwick.com/wealth/wealth.pdf) at the top of the distribution, how avoidance may be [far higher](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/06/28/be-very-skeptical-about-how-much-revenue-elizabeth-warrens-wealth-tax-could-generate/), how it would [interact](https://taxfoundation.org/senator-warren-medicare-for-all-tax-revenue/) with other taxes to shrink total revenue, and how the [Constitution may prevent](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/opinion/wealth-tax-constitution.html) wealth taxes from raising a single dollar.

Without twisting the avoidance research and manufacturing growth projections, the $3.75 trillion Warren needs for her range of policy proposals doesn’t exist.

**Addendum (2019–12–06):** Bernie Sanders has also proposed a [wealth tax](https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/), which has more brackets that reach higher rates than Warren’s:


> It would start with a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million for a married couple. That means a married couple with $32.5 million would pay a wealth tax of just $5,000.


> The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion. These brackets are halved for singles.

Saez and Zucman estimated that Sanders’s wealth tax would raise [$4.35 trillion](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/saez-zucman-wealthtax-sanders-online.pdf) over a decade, using the same assumptions as in scoring the Warren plan. This is a bit higher than the $4.18 trillion projected from their [wealthtaxsimulator.org](http://wealthtaxsimulator.org) tool.

Proper avoidance modeling has a larger effect on the Sanders plan than on the Warren plan, reducing its revenue by 22 percent. After applying the CBO’s growth projection, **revenue drops by a full 28 percent.**

## Distributional analysis of Andrew yang’s freedom dividend

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/distributional-analysis-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-di/
**Published:** 2019-06-24
**Description:** ### Distributional analysis of Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend

### Distributional analysis of Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend

Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang wants to give every adult citizen $1,000 per month, no strings attached. This idea is called universal basic income (UBI), though Yang calls his a [Freedom Dividend](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/the-freedom-dividend/), which he plans to fund with new taxes and an option for households to switch away from current benefits.

If Yang’s plan were implemented, who would come out ahead or behind? How would poverty, inequality, and the deficit change? What benefit programs would be most affected? To answer these questions, I applied the open-source Tax-Calculator software to the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, combined this with established analyses of the new taxes he proposes, and simulated the effect across the distribution of US households. This analysis is static, meaning it ignores behavioral and macroeconomic responses to tax, income, and deficit changes.

While the plan would add $1.4 trillion to the annual deficit, it would be highly progressive, significantly reducing poverty and inequality. 87 percent of Americans would come out ahead, including 90 percent of those in households earning under $50,000 and 54 percent of those in households earning $200,000 or more.


### Modeling the Freedom Dividend

The Freedom Dividend is a set of seven policies, marked here as progressive or regressive by the percentage effect on disposable income:

- $1,000 per month to every adult citizen [progressive]
- Rescinding of benefits for households who opt for the basic income (they can keep their current benefits if they want); the Freedom Dividend does not replace Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, housing, or unemployment insurance [regressive]
- A 10 percent value added tax (VAT, a form of consumption tax common across Europe) [regressive]
- A 0.1 percent, $50 billion per year financial transaction tax (FTT) [progressive]
- A $20 per ton carbon tax (Yang also proposes an additional $20 per ton carbon tax to fund clean energy investments, which is not modeled here) [roughly flat]
- Lifting the cap on Social Security contributions [progressive]
- Treating capital gains as ordinary income [progressive]

My steps for modeling this reform are documented [here](https://github.com/UBICenter/ubi-center/blob/master/notebooks/yang/README.md).


### Pricing out the Freedom Dividend

The total cost of providing $12,000 per year to all 236 million adult citizens is $2.8 trillion. Of these, about 2 million decline the UBI because they get more in current benefits, saving $18 billion. The government saves $133 billion from people who decline their current benefits to get the more generous UBI. The new tax revenue raises $1.2 trillion, leaving the total unfunded cost at $1.4 trillion. This grows the deficit by 160 percent over the $896 billion [projected](https://www.cbo.gov/topics/budget) by the Congressional Budget Office for 2019.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NNtBE0MYGZlJG3KMa1j18Q.png)


### How the revenue sources work

The Freedom Dividend is paid for with benefit savings and taxes. On the benefits side, roughly half of the savings come from Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, a.k.a. food stamps). That is, half the benefit savings comes from people declining SNAP because the UBI would be more generous.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IwC9v5AG6SVtPPuv6E84oQ.png)

Each of the five programs modeled — SNAP, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF, a.k.a. “welfare”), and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) — is mostly superseded by the UBI.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JnWf8F0dEu8dM6Hbel6y6w.png)

On the other side of the revenue generation are taxes. Taken together, the five new taxes reduce by 7 percent the average income of households currently in the bottom nine deciles. The top decile pays 11 percent of income in new taxes, due largely to the elimination of the payroll tax cap and treatment of capital gains as ordinary income.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*XCHRUsbNMOY-zWwY)


### The Freedom Dividend benefits low-income households

Households feel the effect of the Freedom Dividend policy suite in multiple ways: they get the UBI itself (unless they are not citizens or elect to keep their current benefits instead), they decline benefits, they pay higher income taxes, and they pay higher prices on goods and services from the non-income taxes. To evaluate the effect of the policy as a whole, I compare their *disposable income* — income after taxes and transfers — before and after the policy.

Households in the bottom nine deciles see their disposable income rise about $10,000 on average, while households in the top decile lose an average of $8,000.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FeRFFxtkP4o9-xl7UVbctA.png)

This represents a highly progressive outcome, more than doubling the average disposable income of households in the bottom decile and reducing top-decile incomes by about 4 percent.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wpOSfcgTSnGgd6_gyMlsAA.png)

Not all households within each decile experience the tax and benefit changes equally. For example, households in each decile may vary in their levels of SNAP receipt, capital gains, or citizenship. The blue in the chart below shows the share of people in households that would see higher disposable income, while orange is those who see less. Overall, 86 percent of people would come out ahead, though 10 to 15 percent of each income group up to $200,000 would come out behind (these are mostly non-citizens). Almost all households earning more than $500,000 would pay more in taxes than they’d receive from the Freedom Dividend.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FdcZFFLrFFuNitz-mF8I1g.png)


### Exploring effects for household types

UBI Center’s [interactive Plan Explorer](http://plans.ubicenter.org) shows the average effect and range of effects for households with selected characteristics. For example, after selecting a one-adult one-child household with income between $25,000 and $50,000 that receives benefits, this shows that households meeting that criteria come out ahead, on average.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*RulBXc2rBL6sBYvX)

The calculator also shows the range of effects, similarly to the blue and orange chart above:


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qxMH_G2Z0kI5kbz5wTyEeg.png)


### The Freedom Dividend would reduce poverty and inequality

Across all measures, the Freedom Dividend would reduce poverty and income inequality.

One (unofficial) measure of poverty is the share of people in households with disposable income less than the federal poverty line. The Yang plan reduces this share by 74 percent, from 7.3 percent to 1.9 percent. Child poverty falls 54 percent, from 7.9 percent to 3.6 percent.

A common measure of inequality is the Gini index, which ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (a single household has all of society’s income). The Yang plan reduces the Gini index of disposable income by 15 percent, from 0.46 to 0.39.

Other measures of income inequality also fall under the Yang plan: the share of disposable income held by the top 1 percent falls by 24 percent, and the share held by the top 0.1 percent falls 29 percent.

These metrics follow from the full distribution of income rising, but rising especially at the low end. For example, median income rises 25 percent from $56k to $70k, and the 90th percentile rises 6 percent from $159k to $168k. But the 10th percentile rises 48 percent, from $19k to $29k.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0h4yeBJIBAWSu-eNftvvHw.png)


### Economic growth reducing the deficit

The [UBI page](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-ubi/) of Yang’s website states that “The Roosevelt Institute projected that the economy would grow by approximately $2.5 trillion and create 4.6 million new jobs. This would generate approximately $800–900 billion in new revenue from economic growth and activity.”

The Roosevelt [study](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/macroeconomic-effects-universal-basic-income-ubi/) this refers to, authored in 2017, considered a UBI plan that, like Yang’s, gives $1,000 per month to each adult. Unlike Yang’s, it is fully deficit-funded. It projects a GDP increase that phases in over time to reach about $2.4 trillion per year after 6 years (Scenario 3 below, units in billions). It also projects a 9.33 percent deficit increase and 2 percent employment increase.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*LkSHyRE0m1-VLDM_)

Given the US raises [27 cents](https://www.oecd.org/tax/revenue-statistics-united-states.pdf) per dollar of GDP, this $2.4 trillion would raise about $650 billion in new tax revenue, though this might be higher given the new taxes.

The [Penn-Wharton Budget Model](https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2018/3/29/options-for-universal-basic-income-dynamic-modeling) came to a different conclusion in their analysis of a deficit-funded UBI of $500 per month per adult (a response to the Roosevelt study). They estimate that this would reduce GDP by 6.1 percent and reduce government revenue by 8.0 percent over its first decade. Penn-Wharton explains the difference in results by noting their empirically-driven choices to reduce labor supply in response to new income (the *income effect*) and reduce capital services in response to higher government debt.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*h2a_Vsom8NRCLW41)

Neither Roosevelt nor Wharton model the revenue measures Yang proposes: reducing benefits, increasing tax rates, and levying new taxes. Some of these will reduce labor supply, such as new taxes (through the *substitution effect*). Others will increase labor supply, such as moving people out of benefit programs with high marginal tax rates (also through the substitution effect), and the income effect of new taxes (which reduce after-tax income). The net effect of these changes is probably lower labor supply — likely due to workers reducing their work hours rather than dropping out of the labor market — but a full study would be warranted to estimate the magnitude.

Overall, Yang’s projection that his plan would raise between $800 and $900 billion in government revenue through economic growth is unlikely.


### An important discussion

Yang’s plan would grow the federal deficit substantially, but it would also produce a more egalitarian income distribution that would lift tens of millions out of poverty — even accounting for potentially lower economic growth. It demonstrates the importance of considering fiscal policies together: while the VAT and benefit reductions would be regressive on their own, the combination with progressive revenue sources and generous universal payments makes the plan highly progressive overall.

## A budget-neutral version of Andrew yang’s freedom dividend

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/a-budget-neutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-d/
**Published:** 2019-06-24
**Description:** ### A budget-neutral version of Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend

### A budget-neutral version of Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend

[Part 1](https://medium.com/ubicenter/distributional-analysis-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d8dab818bf1b) of this two-part series analyzing Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang’s *Freedom Dividend* showed that the universal basic income policy would reduce poverty and inequality, while adding $1.4 trillion to the annual deficit. Using the same approach and assumptions (no labor market or macroeconomic effects), I find that a budget-neutral plan would provide each adult citizen $471 per month, rather than the $1,000 proposed by Yang. These payments would be offset by Yang’s funding sources: increases on existing taxes, addition of new taxes, and partial replacement of assistance programs.

Like the original Freedom Dividend, this budget-neutral plan would reduce poverty and inequality, and benefit most Americans. However, each of these effects would be muted, and a larger share of middle-income households would come out behind.

As in Part 1, I modeled the plan with the open-source Tax-Calculator software and its version of the Current Population Survey. Code and documentation for the analysis are available [here](https://github.com/UBICenter/ubi-center/tree/master/notebooks/yang).


### Modeling a budget-neutral Freedom Dividend

The Freedom Dividend is a set of seven policies:

- $1,000 per month to every adult citizen
- Rescinding of benefits for households who opt for the basic income (they can keep their current benefits if they want); the Freedom Dividend does not replace Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment insurance, or housing
- A 10 percent value added tax (VAT, a form of consumption tax common across Europe)
- A 0.1 percent, $50 billion per year financial transaction tax (FTT)
- A $20 per ton carbon tax (Yang also proposes an additional $20 per ton carbon tax to fund clean energy investments, which is not modeled here)
- Lifting the cap on Social Security contributions
- Treating capital gains as ordinary income

Following the approach outlined in Part 1, I assume households decline the UBI if the combined value of their current benefits exceeds the UBI; estimate the incidence of carbon taxes, VAT, and FTT using analyses from the Tax Policy Center and the Treasury Department; and calculate the effect of the payroll and capital gains tax reforms with Tax-Calculator. I also assume that workers don’t respond to the new income or changing tax rates; see Part 1 for a discussion on potential macroeconomic effects.

The gross cost of a $1,000 UBI for adult citizens is $2.8 trillion, and after new taxes and benefit savings, the total deficit impact is $1.4 trillion per year (about 160% of the current deficit). Government saves $151 billion from households giving up benefits or declining the UBI to keep current benefits, and the remaining $1.2 trillion comes from tax reform.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*N7NeaP3IRqoHyYNOCDvazw.png)

Varying the UBI amount shows that these funding measures with a $0 UBI would reduce the annual budget deficit by $1.2 trillion. The UBI amount that produces a $0 deficit impact is $471 per month.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*vYUjJnqv23y1_V8d)

The gross cost of giving each adult citizen $478 per month is $1.3 trillion. $128 billion is saved from households declining the UBI or current benefits, and the remaining $1.17 trillion is from new taxes (tax revenue falls slightly because I assume consumption of goods and services that generate carbon tax revenue rises with the UBI).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DIWhTa4TVIprP36tVUb9gQ.png)


### How the revenue sources work

In the original Freedom Dividend, 57 percent of the benefits savings came from SNAP (food stamps), and this share increases to 70 percent with the budget-neutral version. This follows from SNAP’s relatively wide reach and low monthly amount. For example, TANF and SSI have higher monthly amounts, and the share of dollars for these plans given up for UBI falls from more than half with the $1,000 per month plan to about 30 percent at $471 per month.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HUwBV2MNUpDj9tuxdsRhBw.png)

The tax side is almost identical to the original Freedom Dividend, since the lower amount affects only the carbon tax. New taxes cost each decile an average of 8 percent of income, except the top decile which is cost 12 percent.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*oeFCDyVTKbSggO2X)


### A budget-neutral Freedom Dividend would be progressively redistributive

The average household in the bottom 80 percent would see disposable incomes rise by about $3,000 per year, while the average household in the top 10 percent would lose about $21,000 per year.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ndEYM2FwpkMRclhIm_Vigw.png)

As a share of disposable income, those numbers are progressive at every decile, raising the bottom decile 47 percent and lowering the top decile by 9 percent (compared to +119 percent and -4 percent in the $1,000 plan).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PZ-m6BenNQHKc71gXHdYqA.png)

Various measures of poverty and inequality would fall:

- Poverty falls 35 percent, as defined by the share of people in households with disposable income below the federal poverty guideline.Not an official poverty measure.
- The Gini index (a measure of general inequality) falls 9 percent.
- The top 1 percent’s share of income falls 17 percent.
- The top 0.1 percent’s share of income falls 21 percent.

These inequality measures reflect how the plan compresses the income distribution at both top and bottom: the budget-neutral Freedom Dividend raises the 10th income percentile by 17 percent, raises median income by 6 percent, and reduces the 90th percentile by 2 percent.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FWy9F9qpxGOq5lkHlLySHw.png)


### Most come out ahead, many come out behind

While the budget-neutral Freedom Dividend is progressive on a net basis and the bottom 8 deciles benefit on average, the new taxes outweigh the UBI for many households. Two thirds of Americans would benefit, including 46 percent who would see disposable incomes rise more than 5 percent; the third who come out behind includes 18 percent who lose more than 5 percent. While these net contributors are concentrated among households with income of $200,000 or more, about 20 percent of households with income under $75,000 also come out behind.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2bMWsZpvEw2MvZYm57t12A.png)

High income households primarily come out behind because their tax liability would rise considerably, especially payroll and capital gains taxes. For example, using the UBI Center [Plan Explorer](http://plans.ubicenter.org), we can filter to one-adult households with income above $500,000, who would pay an average of $11,411 more in taxes each month. All households in this category would lose.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1IwXTUdzxKuAI7Ao)

Low income households primarily come out behind because they forego benefits to get the UBI, or vice versa, and only pay new taxes like VAT. For example, one-adult households with income below $25,000 gain an average of $251 per month on net, while 8 percent come out behind.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yMCVcrYsmWCt-AE60l69Kw.png)

Further filtering these to households that receive benefits, the net effect is +$97 per month and 21 percent see incomes fall. This subset includes 12 million people, 40 percent of all one-adult households with income below $25,000.


### Major policy tends toward disruption

Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend and its budget-neutral adaptation analyzed here would likely have a greater impact on poverty and inequality than any seriously discussed policy in recent U.S. history. For some, this egalitarian result would be worth major economic costs, including to their own pocketbook; others will oppose it for concern over the macro economy or their personal finances.

One thing is certain though: it’s hard to design major policy without disruption. If society determines how this disruption stacks up against other outcomes of interest (poverty, inequality, work incentives, economic growth), policymakers can design plans accordingly.

But can we have our cake and eat it, too? That’s the question the UBI Center intends to answer in developing UBI plans that balance disruption against other measurable outcomes. Optimizing for the deficit is just the start.

## Andrew yang’s troubling Tucker Carlson interview

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/andrew-yangs-troubling-tucker-carlson-interview/
**Published:** 2019-03-09
**Description:** ### Andrew Yang’s Troubling Tucker Carlson Interview

### Andrew Yang’s Troubling Tucker Carlson Interview


#### The Democratic presidential candidate fed into Tucker’s MAGA narrative

Last Friday, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang joined Fox News’s *Tucker Carlson Tonight* for a [5-minute interview](https://youtu.be/bMVCkhyg5kA). Consistent with his [book](https://www.amazon.com/War-Normal-People-Disappearing-Universal/dp/0316414247) and [platform](https://www.yang2020.com/policies), Yang warned of a coming wave of job losses due to automation, citing the fall in Midwest manufacturing employment and the 3.5 million truck drivers at risk of replacement by autonomous vehicle technology.

Yang normally uses this premise to motivate his policy prescriptions, especially the [Freedom Dividend](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/the-freedom-dividend/) — a [universal basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income) funded by a [value-added tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax) — central to his campaign. I support (and [have](https://medium.com/basic-income/if-we-can-afford-our-current-welfare-system-we-can-afford-basic-income-9ae9b5f186af) [written on](https://medium.com/@MaxGhenis/the-case-for-a-person-centric-basic-income-plan-55e90010fc9e)) universal basic income, so I appreciate him bringing that issue into the national discourse. But his interview with Carlson showed the dangers of the tenuously-grounded populist frame he’s associating with that policy.


### A recurring misleading claim on labor force participation rate

Carlson introduced Yang by warning of the dangers of automation and technology. After describing self-driving trucks, to back up his assertion that technology is already displacing workers, he [said](https://youtu.be/bMVCkhyg5kA?t=206):


> Labor force participation rate in the United States is 63.2 percent, the same level as Ecuador and Costa Rica.

This echoes his statements on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AndrewYangVFA/status/1073214206823071744) and the [Joe Rogan Experience](https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8?t=971), in which he compared the US to El Salvador and Dominican Republic. Yang is referring to the civilian labor force participation rate (LFPR), [defined](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm#definitions) by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) as the share of people age 16 or older who are working or actively seeking work. It’s hovered around 63 percent since 2013, down from 67 percent around 2000, and the most recent data is from January 2019 at 63.2 percent.


![Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*RuNvarFW1o1Xyut-)

Data from the World Bank differs slightly from BLS (age 15+ instead of 16+, and as of 2018) but shows that the US LFPR is about in the middle of the pack (61.6 percent, higher than 46 percent of countries). While it’s similar to El Salvador, it’s substantially lower than Ecuador and Dominican Republic, and somewhat higher than Costa Rica. The United Kingdom and South Korea are both more similar to the United States than most of the countries Yang lists.

The bigger problem is that LFPR is largely a function of demographics, especially the number of retirees. The higher life expectancy in the US combined with Social Security and Medicare means that more people live long enough to spend their later years out of the labor force. Indeed, Americans can expect to live considerably longer than residents of Ecuador, El Salvador and Dominican Republic.


![Source: Author’s calculations from World Bank data](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*gtsee_UJnwV4Ln7O)

A straightforward way to correct for this bias is to limit the population to people in more typical working ages. For example, the US BLS defines [“prime-age” LFPR](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300060) as LFPR among people aged 25–54, to account for young people being in school and early retirement. This has been rising since 2015, and is currently 82.6 percent, within 2 percentage points of its all-time high in 1997.


![Source: FRED](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hESSB800lk3y_aPg)

25–54 LFPR isn’t available across countries, but limiting to age 15–64 puts the US alongside France and Hong Kong, and higher than all four of Yang’s comparison countries, even though we have [far more young people in college](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.TER.ENRR?locations=US-CR-DO-EC-SV&view=chart). Unlike 15+ LFPR, 15–64 LFPR also significantly correlates to both GDP per capita and life expectancy.


![Source: Author’s calculations from World Bank data](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*5XhGRKwbSr9nSxK9)


### Life expectancy and metrics other than GDP

With Carlson, Yang [continued](https://youtu.be/bMVCkhyg5kA?t=234):


> We have a series of bad numbers and I referred to GDP as one certainly, a headline unemployment rate is completely misleading and one of my mandates as president is I’m going to update the numbers [so] they actually make sense.

Yang expounds on this in his [Human-Centered Capitalism](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/human-capitalism/) policy page — one of his top three objectives, along with the Freedom Dividend and Medicare for All— saying that as President he would:


> Change the way we measure the economy, from GDP and the stock market to…new measurements like Median Income and Standard of Living, Health-adjusted Life Expectancy, Mental Health, Childhood Success Rates, Social and Economic Mobility, Absence of Substance Abuse, and other measurements.

It’s not clear what he means by “update the numbers,” given the metrics he describes are either vague (what’s Childhood Success Rate?) or already [reported by government agencies](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=nah2), [studied by economists](https://www.economy.com/dismal/analysis/datapoints/296127/There-Is-No-US-Wage-Growth-Mystery/), and [covered by the media](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/us-life-expectancy-declines-again-a-dismal-trend-not-seen-since-world-war-i/2018/11/28/ae58bc8c-f28c-11e8-bc79-68604ed88993_story.html).

They also generally tell similar stories: unemployment-related indicators move together (and have been stable over the past few years), and absolute indicators like income (adjusted for inflation to capture living standards) and life expectancy have improved over the long run and are now at all-time highs. Illicit substance use is generally [falling](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/nationwide-trends) too, with the exception of opioids and (non-problematically) cannabis.


![Source: Author’s calculations from FRED data (U6 first became available in 1994). Yang frequently cites LFPR, but since this includes people seeking work, it’s less relevant to unemployment discussions than the employment-population ratio (EPOP, the inverse of which is the top dark red line).](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*OTCG3xRTctpjT0RK)


![Source: Author’s calculations from FRED data. Median personal income and life expectancy are only available through 2016, but real GDP per capita has continued to rise to a record high in Q4 2018.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*id8sVCQ2eQRzLLwz)

Especially notable here is the longer life expectancy, given Yang [also said](https://youtu.be/bMVCkhyg5kA?t=250) in the interview that “our life expectancy has declined for the last three years, first time in a hundred years.” This decline should raise alarm about the need for public policy addressing the [opioids and suicides](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/11/us-life-expectancy-keeps-falling/576664/) explaining it, and Yang has noted this elsewhere. But we shouldn’t miss the forest through the trees: life expectancy fell by two months from 2014 to 2016, while it grew by that much *every year* from 1990 to 2014.

Could greater funding for statistical agencies generate more valuable insights for policymakers to improve American lives? Of course. But there’s no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater: the currently available statistics tell us that Americans are richer and healthier in recent years than they’ve ever been.


### Feeding into the Trump-Carlson narrative

Absent policy prescriptions, Yang’s vision of America doesn’t look so different from the one Donald Trump described as a presidential candidate in 2016. Yang calls the unemployment rate “completely misleading;” Trump called it a [“hoax.”](http://fortune.com/2016/08/08/donald-trump-hoax/) Yang cites the slight anomalous fall in life expectancy despite long-run improvement; Trump [cited](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-said-crime-rising-its-not-and-hasnt-b/) a slight anomalous increase in crime despite a long-run fall. Yang warns of the labor devastation from automation; Trump [warned](https://www.apnews.com/09215cf7f37f4c6ea05f92f8c83e6125) of immigrants taking jobs.

Certainly, Yang’s arguments hold more water than Trump’s: he hasn’t claimed the “real” unemployment rate was as high as [42 percent](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-unemployment-rate-may-be-42-perc/); the trend in life expectancy has more real basis than the crime blip; and automation [really has](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/25/most-americans-unaware-that-as-u-s-manufacturing-jobs-have-disappeared-output-has-grown/) produced more clear job losses than immigration. And while this interview skipped policy implications, Yang’s proposal for universal basic income is productive and future-oriented, not hateful and backwards-looking like Trump’s border wall.


![Source: Pew Research](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*4r1JlPMnM6LBBnh3)

And yet, if he’s being trotted on Fox News to back up their host’s warnings of “the dangers of big tech” and “why [we should] be worried about automation,” and if that host describes him as “one of the only people [he’s] ever met who’s honest about the effects of deindustrialization,” it’s important that he’s describing those effects truthfully. Given Carlson’s [racist fearmongering](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/11/01/tucker_carlson_media_push_narrative_that_migrant_caravan_is_not_a_threat_model_future_americans.html) of Latin American immigration, it’s especially important that comparisons of labor market indicators between the United States and Latin American countries are valid.


![This fabricated quote from Fox News is almost understandable given the interview’s disposition.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fy1LjB_ebLbFfgZe)

By these objectives, Yang’s interview did more to bolster the doom-and-gloom narrative that Carlson feeds his audience — which benefits populist politicians like Donald Trump — than improve the standing of his ideas. Yang can avoid falling into this trap by making sure to pair his description of the country with his ideas for improving it. Better still would be re-examining his premise of the country’s perils: his policies like [UBI](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/17/15364546/universal-basic-income-review-stern-murray-automation) don’t need it, and the evidence contradicts it.

## Quantile regression, from linear models to trees to deep learning

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/quantile-regression-from-linear-models-to-trees-to/
**Published:** 2018-10-16
**Description:** ### Quantile regression, from linear models to trees to deep learning

### Quantile regression, from linear models to trees to deep learning

Suppose a real estate analyst wants to predict home prices from factors like home age and distance from job centers. The typical goal will be generating the best home price *point estimate* given those factors, where “best” often refers to the estimate that minimizes squared deviations from reality.

But what if they want to predict not just a single estimate, but also the likely range? This is called the *prediction interval*, and the general method for producing them is known as *quantile regression*. In this post I’ll describe how this problem is formalized; how to implement it in six linear, tree-based, and deep learning methods (in Python — [here’s the Jupyter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nXOlrmVHqCHiixqiMF6H8LSciz583_W2)); and how they perform against real-world datasets.


### Quantile regression minimizes quantile loss

Just as regressions minimize the squared-error loss function to predict a single point estimate, quantile regressions minimize the *quantile loss *in predicting a certain quantile. The most popular quantile is the median, or the 50th percentile, and in this case the quantile loss is simply the sum of *absolute* errors. Other quantiles could give endpoints of a prediction interval; for example a middle-80-percent range is defined by the 10th and 90th percentiles. The quantile loss differs depending on the evaluated quantile, such that more negative errors are penalized more for higher quantiles and more positive errors are penalized more for lower quantiles.

Before digging into the formula, suppose we’ve made a prediction for a single point with a true value of zero, and our predictions range from -1 to +1; that is, our errors also range from -1 to +1. This graph shows how the quantile loss varies with the error, depending on the quantile.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ufWnnvTA9AkjKrfI)

Let’s look at each line separately:

- The medium blue line shows the median, which is symmetric around zero, where all losses equal zero because the prediction was perfect. Looks good so far: the median aims to bisect the set of predictions, so we want to weigh underestimates equally to overestimates. As we’ll see soon, the quantile loss around the median is half the absolute deviation, so 0.5 at both -1 and +1, and 0 at 0.
- The light blue line shows the 10th percentile, which assigns a lower loss to negative errors and a higher loss to positive errors. The 10th percentile means we think there’s a 10 percent chance that the true value is below that predicted value, so it makes sense to assign less of a loss to underestimates than to overestimates.
- The dark blue line shows the 90th percentile, which is the reverse pattern from the 10th percentile.

We can also look at this by quantile for under- and over-estimated predictions. The higher the quantile, the more the quantile loss function penalizes underestimates and the less it penalizes overestimates.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*La2_sFKLXl6Rw16w)

Given this intuition, here’s the quantile loss formula ([source](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-quantile-regression-c85481548b5a)):


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*sBQtWnFYbxUErMfD)

And in Python code, where we can replace the branched logic with a `maximum` statement:


```
def quantile_loss(q, y, f):  # q: Quantile to be evaluated, e.g., 0.5 for median.  # y: True value.  # f: Fitted (predicted) value.  e = y - f  return np.maximum(q * e, (q - 1) * e)
```

Next we’ll look at the six methods — OLS, linear quantile regression, random forests, gradient boosting, Keras, and TensorFlow — and see how they work with some real data.


### The data

This analysis will use the [Boston housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing), which contains 506 observations representing towns in the Boston area. It includes 13 features alongside the target, the median value of owner-occupied homes. Quantile regression therefore is predicting the share of towns (not homes) with median home values below a value.

I train the models on 80 percent and test on the remaining 20 percent. For easier visualization, the first set of models uses a single feature: `AGE`, the proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940. As we might expect, towns with older homes have lower home values, though the relationship is noisy.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*iWF8FCQyC_Nh2RQ3)

For each method, we’ll predict the 10th, 30th, 50th, 70th, and 90th percentiles on the test set.


### Ordinary least squares

Although OLS predicts the mean rather than the median, we can still calculate prediction intervals from it based on standard errors and the inverse normal CDF:


```
def ols_quantile(m, X, q):  # m: OLS statsmodels model.  # X: X matrix.  # q: Quantile.  mean_pred = m.predict(X)  se = np.sqrt(m.scale)  return mean_pred + norm.ppf(q) * se
```

This baseline approach produces linear and parallel quantiles centered around the mean (which is predicted as the median). A well-tuned model will show about 80 percent of dots in between the top and bottom lines. Note the dots differ from the first scatter plot, as here we’re showing the test set to evaluate out-of-sample predictions.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*swvEEDGS68RR0fUb)


### Linear quantile regression

Linear models extend beyond the mean to the median and other quantiles. Linear quantile regression predicts a given quantile, relaxing OLS’s parallel trend assumption while still imposing linearity (under the hood, it’s minimizing quantile loss). This is straightforward with `statsmodels` :


```
sm.QuantReg(train_labels, X_train).fit(q=q).predict(X_test)# Provide q.
```


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fzc8JnVklM7Gj_Kn)


### Random forests

Our first departure from linear models is [random forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest), a collection of trees. While this model doesn’t explicitly predict quantiles, we can treat each tree as a possible value, and calculate quantiles using its [empirical CDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function) ([Ando Saabas has written more on this](https://blog.datadive.net/prediction-intervals-for-random-forests/)):


```
def rf_quantile(m, X, q):  # m: sklearn random forests model.  # X: X matrix.  # q: Quantile.  rf_preds = []  for estimator in m.estimators_:    rf_preds.append(estimator.predict(X))  # One row per record.  rf_preds = np.array(rf_preds).transpose()  return np.percentile(rf_preds, q * 100, axis=1)
```

It goes a bit crazy in this case, suggesting overfitting. Since random forests are more commonly used for high-dimensional datasets, we’ll return to them after adding more features to the model.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*9ez_bYKF7SrVOPkK)


### Gradient boosting

Another tree-based method is [gradient boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting), `scikit-learn`’s [implementation of which](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html) supports explicit quantile prediction:


```
ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor(loss='quantile', alpha=q)
```

While not as jumpy as the random forests, it doesn’t look to do great on the one-feature model either.

### Keras (deep learning)

[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a user-friendly wrapper for neural network toolkits including [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org). We can use deep neural networks to predict quantiles by passing the quantile loss function. The code is somewhat involved, so check out the [Jupyter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nXOlrmVHqCHiixqiMF6H8LSciz583_W2#scrollTo=g7s7Grj-A-Sf) or [read more from](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-quantile-regression-c85481548b5a) [Sachin Abeywardana](https://medium.com/u/4d883eeaf62d) to see how it works.

Underlying most deep nets are linear models with kinks (called *rectified linear units*, or *ReLUs*), which we can see here visually: Keras predicts more bunching up of home values for towns with about 70 percent built before 1940, while fanning out more at the very low and very high ends of age. This seems to be a good prediction based on fit of the test data.

### TensorFlow

One disadvantage of Keras is that each quantile must be trained separately. To leverage patterns common to the quantiles, we have to go to TensorFlow itself. See the [Jupyter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nXOlrmVHqCHiixqiMF6H8LSciz583_W2#scrollTo=g7s7Grj-A-Sf) and [Jacob Zweig](https://medium.com/u/4459aa7bce57)’s [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-quantile-regression-in-tensorflow-1dbc792fe597) to learn more about this.

We can see this co-learning across the quantiles in its predictions, where the model learns a common kink rather than separate ones for each quantile. This looks to be a good Occam-inspired choice.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*jACva6ArwF4L_Vwt)


### Which did best?

Eyeballing suggests that deep learning did well, linear models did OK, and tree-based methods did poorly, but can we quantify which is best? Yes we can, using quantile loss over the test set.

Recall that the quantile loss differs depending on the quantile. Since we calculated five quantiles, we have five quantile losses for each observation in the test set. Averaging over all quantile-observations confirms the visual intuition: random forests did worst, while TensorFlow did best.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*TE_SIChhR9fSV9bO)

We can also break this out by quantile, revealing that tree-based methods did especially poorly at the 90th percentile, while deep learning did best at the lower quantiles.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*SmMb_wtpgU2Kxnf2)


### Larger datasets give more opportunity to improve over OLS

So random forests was awful for this one-feature dataset, but that’s not what they’re made for. What happens if we add the other 12 features to the Boston housing model?


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ybjeY9K-tED8hfbD)

The tree-based methods made a comeback, and while the OLS improved, the gap between OLS and other non-tree methods grew.

Real-world problems often extend beyond predicting means. Maybe an app developer is interested not only in users’ expected usage, but also their probability of becoming super-users. Or an auto insurance company wants to know the chance of a driver’s high-value claim at different thresholds. Economists might want to stochastically impute information from one dataset onto another, picking from the CDF to ensure proper variation (an example I’ll explore in a follow-up post).

Quantile regression is valuable for each of these use cases, and machine learning tools can often outperform linear models, especially the easy-to-use tree-based methods. Try it out on your own data and let me know how it goes!

## We should replace the child tax credit with a universal child benefit

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/we-should-replace-the-child-tax-credit-with-a-univ/
**Published:** 2018-04-22
**Description:** ### We should replace the Child Tax Credit with a universal child benefit

### We should replace the Child Tax Credit with a universal child benefit

The Child Tax Credit (CTC) is one of the largest assistance programs for children in the US. With a newly expanded budgetary impact of $120 billion, it will reach 40 million households this year — 88 percent of all households with children.¹ ² For families that receive it, the CTC is highly effective, having lifted [1.5 million children](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/policy-basics-the-child-tax-credit) out of poverty in 2016. This success has brought it bipartisan support, with both [Hillary Clinton](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2016/10/13/clintons-child-tax-credit-proposal-a-good-start-on-helping-low-and-middle-income-families/) and [Marco Rubio](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/19/what-marco-rubio-got-for-his-tax-vote/?utm_term=.b7e3c72d928c) having proposed expansions in the past couple years. However, like most tax credits, it provides little if any assistance to the poorest households who need it most.

There’s an easy fix: replace the CTC with a universal child benefit, a payment given monthly to parents for each of their children. I modeled this in a [new paper](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Av1-CTBZpmDGkiG_hyoXqCi4-S1DQUCv) using the open-source [Tax-Calculator](http://pslmodels.github.io/Tax-Calculator/) software,³ showing that such a reform would be highly progressive.

A revenue-neutral plan would give $1,500 per child per year,⁴ increasing by 7 percent the after-tax incomes of the bottom quartile of households with children, at a small expense to higher earning households. Or for a cost of $42 billion — a 36 percent increase to the CTC budgetary impact — we could match the CTC’s maximum of $2,000 per child per year (currently unavailable to many families), boosting incomes of the bottom quartile by 13 percent while either benefiting or not affecting other groups. Both options reduce poverty and inequality, and provide parents with a steady, dependable income to care for their children, instead of an uncertain amount every April.


### Who currently benefits from the Child Tax Credit?

For each child under age 17, the CTC can reduce tax bills by up to $2,000. Among [other restrictions](https://www.thebalance.com/child-tax-credit-3193009), the core credit phases out for very high incomes, and does not reduce tax liability below zero, effectively excluding filers with very low incomes. However, it has a refund mechanism called the Additional Child Tax Credit which can reduce liability below zero. The rules and formulas around the Additional Child Tax Credit [are complicated](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/filing/credits/child-tax-credit/) and [changed in 2018](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/irs/tax-reform/new-child-tax-credit/), but it results in a credit that’s considerably less generous than the nonrefundable component higher earners receive.

The December 2017 tax bill changed the CTC in a few ways, most importantly: (a) doubling the maximum amount to $2,000, and (b) raising the income threshold before it phases out. This increased the program’s annual budgetary impact by 130 percent, from $52 billion to $120 billion.

Given the complexities of the two credits, distribution of actual outcomes are useful for understanding the credit’s benefit. This chart shows the average credit value per CTC-eligible child (essentially being age 16 or younger) based on the household’s percentile of after-tax after-transfer income (that is, including programs like food stamps; called “income” from here on) without the credit. The analysis is limited to households with at least one child eligible for the CTC, and “child” is defined as children eligible for the CTC.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mfffKJMhH3jZx34nUgNnkw.png)

The average credit per child exceeds $1,500 for most percentiles outside the bottom third, up until the top 1 to 2 percent — those with pre-tax incomes above $270,000 or so — who are ineligible. But for the very poor, it provides little benefit. Further, the Republican tax bill disproportionately helped upper-middle income families, without addressing the disparity for very low earners.


### What if it were shared with every child?

The simplest way to avoid the regressiveness of partially-refundable tax credits is to transform them into universal transfers. If we were to share the CTC’s current $120 billion budgetary impact with our 80 million children, each would get $1,500.⁵ This would raise by 7 percent the after-tax after-transfer income of the bottom quartile of tax units with children, while reducing it by under half a percent for the upper 75 percent. Infusing $42 billion to make it $2,000 per child would raise the bottom quartile’s incomes by 11 percent, and also raise the upper 75 percent by 0.6 percent. While the revenue-neutral plan has a relatively constant effect across the upper three quartiles, the $2,000 benefit would be progressive at each quartile.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*V2WQ0nmYNMuM78gW7ckRKw.png)

Even this understates the benefits to the poorest families. Zooming in on the bottom quartile shows that the bottom 5 percent increase their incomes by 120 percent in the revenue-neutral plan and 160 percent in the $2,000 plan. This group’s current average income is $3.30 per person per day, including transfer programs like food stamps and Medicaid (with the caveat that measuring extremes of the income distribution [has its challenges](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MaxGhenis/taxcalc-notebooks/blob/master/exploratory/tax_units_with_lowest_aftertax_income.ipynb)).


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9wZRE17sqrmKvo3vv0UlKQ.png)

While the Republican tax bill extended the CTC to most high-income households, it still phases out for filers with incomes above $200,000, or $400,000 if filing jointly. That means that universal child benefits would benefit this top roughly 2 percent of tax filers with children, increasing their incomes by 0.2 percent (0.4 percent in the $2,000 plan). The benefit could be paired with a higher top-bracket marginal rate — which was reduced from 39.6 percent to 37 percent as part of the tax bill — to avoid this result.


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jI8MJNJIQHKD-jUSfd-c-w.png)

Even with the benefit to the top 1 percent, both plans reduce inequality, as measured by the popular [Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient). This measure lies between 0 (perfect equality) and 1 (perfect inequality), and is currently 0.451 among US households with children. The revenue-neutral plan would reduce it to 0.446, while the $2,000 plan would reduce it to 0.441.


### A child benefit would put us on par with other countries

[Many countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_benefit) have child benefits of some sort. While most are means-tested or change depending on the number of children, the US would not be alone in enacting a flat benefit for all children. [Ireland](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html) and [Sweden](https://www.forsakringskassan.se/privatpers/foralder/nar_barnet_ar_fott/barnbidrag/!ut/p/z0/fYzLDoIwEAC_puctqNwJKD4OxpAo9tIUKaRKtmW7IX6-6Ad4m0kmAwoaUGhmNxh2Hs24-F1ler0vi6Qq5Om8qUuZZ4dLcq236S5dQW0RjqD-R8vFPadJ5aAeHtm-GZofIEerycbgMbrZChnIzYaDpShk78mMnSUh0ZBuDaFlvVDvmYX8eus6MgOEV3X7AGdh2ls!/) are two such countries, giving families the equivalent of $2,070 and $1,540 per child under 16 per year, respectively.⁶ Canada’s child benefit was also universal (though taxable) until it became means-tested in 2016.

Evidence from around the world shows that these child benefits work. As [Vox’s Dylan Matthews summarizes](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/27/15388696/child-benefit-universal-cash-tax-credit-allowance), child benefits and other cash benefits to families not only reduce child poverty, but lead families to spend more time with children, increase rates of prenatal care, improve children’s physical and mental health, and ultimately boost kids’ learning outcomes and earnings later in life.

Flat amounts can also avoid macro-level disadvantages of means-testing: [administrative overhead, abuse by politicians, tensions between recipients and nonrecipients](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2017/05/31/rethinking-the-universalism-versus-targeting-debate), [welfare cliffs](https://www.budget.senate.gov/newsroom/budget-background/the-welfare-cliff-how-the-benefit-scale-discourages-work) (implicit marginal tax rates exceeding 100 percent), and difficulty in distributing more frequently than annually.

These virtues have motivated other scholars to advocate child benefit plans, including [Hammond and Orr (2016)](https://niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/UniversalChildBenefit_final.pdf), [Shaefer et al (2018)](https://www.rsfjournal.org/doi/abs/10.7758/RSF.2018.4.2.02), and [Bitler, Hines, and Page (2018)](https://www.rsfjournal.org/doi/abs/10.7758/RSF.2018.4.2.03).


### The beginning of the end of child poverty

A child benefit in the US would significantly cut child poverty. There’s no single measure of child poverty, but these four are commonly used:

- Extreme poverty is defined internationally by the World Bank as consumption⁷ below $1.90 per day per person, in 2011 dollars adjusted for purchasing power. That’s about $780 in 2018 dollars per person per year in the US.Estimate: Under 0.1 percent (Brookings Institution analysis of 2011 data). No child-specific data available.
- The US poverty threshold is defined by the US Census Bureau. It is based on the number and age of household members, and only includes earnings and cash transfers (not taxes, tax credits, or in-kind transfers), so will be unaffected by changes to the CTC. The 2017 threshold for a household with one person under age 65 and one child was $16,895.Estimate: 21 percent of children (National Center for Children on Poverty report, no year specified).
- The US poverty guideline (often called the federal poverty line, or FPL) is defined by the department of Health and Human Services to determine eligibility for programs like Medicaid. Like the poverty threshold, it is based on pre-tax cash alone, but it does not depend on age. For the contiguous states, HHS defines the FPL as $12,140 for a household with one person, plus $4,320 for each additional person.Estimate: None available.
- The US Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) is defined by the Census Bureau. It includes taxes and transfers — cash and in-kind — and is adjusted based on local cost of living.Estimate: 15.6 percent of children (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis of 2016 data).

None of these is ideal for estimating the poverty reduction resulting from replacing the CTC with a child benefit. Extreme poverty measures consumption, not income; neither the poverty threshold nor guideline include tax credits like the CTC; and Tax-Calculator data lacks geographic granularity needed for the SPM.

Instead, I use these measures:

- Extreme poverty by income, at the same $780 defined by the World Bank, using income rather than consumption. Estimates of the poorest Americans are unreliable, but this provides a rough relative picture.
- Federal poverty line (FPL) including taxes and transfers, using levels defined for the contiguous states.
- $10,000 per person per year, a simple threshold.

By all three measures, both the revenue-neutral and $2,000 child benefit significantly reduce the share of children living in impoverished households. The impact is most significant for the extreme poverty measure, which falls from 1.8 percent to 0.4 percent and 0.2 percent for the two respective plans. Using the FPL, the child poverty rate falls by 15 percent and 22 percent, respectively, and it falls by 6 percent and 13 percent using the $10,000 threshold. The existing CTC also cuts child poverty using the FPL and $10,000 thresholds, but has virtually no effect on extreme child poverty.

Throughout its [twenty-year history](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41873.pdf), the Child Tax Credit has helped middle-income families care for the future of our country. The nominal value of the credit has grown over time, and it has slowly become more available to low-income families through partial refundability.

It should culminate in a universal child benefit, completing its path toward inclusivity and fulfilling its mission to help the poorest families. Doing so would not only alleviate poverty and stem inequality, it would provide a common baseline footing for every child in America. A universal child benefit in our policy arsenal would provide a tool that could be expanded over time, and which could ultimately eliminate the scourge of child poverty.

*[1] “Households” in this analysis refer to tax units, as this is the core unit in the Tax-Calculator software. Households can contain multiple tax units (e.g. in households where spouses file separately), and the US has 20 percent more tax units than households. Tax-Calculator also imputes tax units that might not have filed using CPS data.*

*[2] Children here are defined as children eligible to receive the Child Tax Credit, the primary criterion of which is being age 16 or younger.*

*[4] Rounded from an exactly revenue-neutral amount of $1,470; this rounding would cost $2.4 billion.*

*[5] Tax-Calculator’s CPS data estimates a $117 billion budgetary impact and 80 million CTC-eligible children. Other estimates are ~$114–120 billion, and the Census estimates 70 million children under age 17. To produce consistent distributional estimates, I use Tax-Calculator’s CPS data, but the full paper includes other estimates.*

*[6] Ireland also gives their child benefit to some 16- and 17-year-olds.*

## The case for a wonky basic income plan

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/the-case-for-a-wonky-basic-income-plan/
**Published:** 2017-06-14
**Description:** ### The Case For a Wonky Basic Income Plan

### The Case For a Wonky Basic Income Plan

In March, a former union leader joined forces with a prominent libertarian to [debate](https://youtu.be/YX9T7GHs9fQ?t=22m6s) two Obama White House economists. The topic, hosted by [Intelligence²](http://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/universal-basic-income-safety-net-future), was “Is Universal Basic Income The Safety Net of the Future?” with the unlikely duo — Andy Stern, President Emeritus of the Service Employees International Union, and Charles Murray, fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute — arguing the case for, and the economists — Jared Bernstein, former chief economist to Vice President Biden, and Jason Furman, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors — arguing against. Stern pitched universal basic income — giving every person a check each month without conditions — as insurance for a future where AI and robots make human workers obsolete; Murray lauded the personal liberty from solving poverty without a paternalistic bureaucracy. Bernstein and Furman claimed the math didn’t add up; that the universality requires reducing benefits for the poor, especially families with children; and that other changes needed to pay for the program would be politically infeasible.


![From left: Charles Murray, Andy Stern, Robert Rosenkranz (moderator), Jared Bernstein, and Jason Furman.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*gemScvntAOBh9p4s.)

Economists have expressed skepticism of this idea elsewhere. Bob Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities [questions](https://www.vox.com/2017/5/12/13954182/case-for-and-against-universal-basic-income-united-states) the compatibility of such a large expenditure with today’s political climate. A [2016 survey](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/universal-basic-income) found that 70% of economists opposed replacing all transfer programs with a basic income of $13,000 per year for adults age 21 and over. Others like [blogger Tyler Cowen](http://marginalrevolution.com) believe that [work, not money](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-27/my-second-thoughts-about-universal-basic-income), is the central problem for the country.

And yet, there’s a lot for economists (and us all) to like about basic income. It

- Fills in the gaps of the current safety net, which often fails to reach the poorest and unemployed.
- Eliminates welfare traps, where beneficiaries lose more in benefits than they earn if they choose to work more or accept a raise (i.e., improves work incentives).
- Utilizes cash, which 84% of economists agree increases welfare more than in-kind benefits do.
- Consolidates the portfolio of programs made costly by its complexity (even large ones cost ~10% to administer).
- Simplifies the bureaucracy that’s difficult for beneficiaries to navigate.

Their concerns are often not about basic income per se, but about the plans proposed. Political challenges aside, economists’ most compelling critique may be that existing plans harm those in most need, especially families with children. Bernstein and Furman drilled this point in the Intelligence² debate, leading them to victory: while 20% of the audience initially opposed the motion that “the universal basic income is the safety net of the future”, 61% opposed it afterward.

The good news is: it’s entirely possible to design a basic income plan that minimizes the net losses (and therefore political opposition) to beneficiaries and taxpayers, while still respecting the core tenets of basic income — universality, individuality, and focus on cash. Doing so requires a *person-centric* perspective, whereby we consider the current benefits received and taxes paid by all Americans today, and design the plan with the explicit goal of giving as many people as possible at least as much as they currently get.

This would be hard work, and I’ve not (yet) formed a specific plan. This piece lays out the justification for a new approach to basic income policy design, describes a framework for this design, and proposes negative income tax as a conceptual starting point. Such a policy can win expert support for basic income by emphasizing welfare of individuals.


### The current plans

Stern and Murray were appropriate defenders against Bernstein and Furman, as they have proposed some of the most specific and widely-cited plans for basic income in the US. Prominent basic income advocate Scott Santens also released a plan in June. So it’s worth summarizing the [Stern](https://futurism.com/heres-how-we-could-fund-a-ubi-program-in-the-united-states/), [Murray](http://www.fljs.org/files/publications/Murray.pdf), and [Santens](https://medium.com/economicsecproj/how-to-reform-welfare-and-taxes-to-provide-every-american-citizen-with-a-basic-income-bc67d3f4c2b8) plans on a few dimensions:

- Annual amount Stern: $12,000Murray: $10,000, plus $3,000 to purchase catastrophic health insuranceSantens: $13,266 for adults, $4,598 for children
- Eligible age population (all plans are limited to US citizens)Stern: 18–64, though seniors can opt in if Social Security (which remains) pays less than $12,000 per yearMurray: 21+Santens: All (lower amount for children)
- Replaced programs (I consider the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit (CTC) “programs” instead of tax changes, to align with the IRS)Stern: “all or some number of the 126 [federal] welfare programs that currently cost $1 trillion a year” excluding healthcare programs like Medicaid and CHIP; also cuts military spendingMurray: “Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, welfare programmes, social service programmes, agricultural subsidies, and corporate welfare”Santens: “Food and nutrition assistance programs ($108 billion)[,] temporary assistance for needy families ($17 billion)…the earned income credit ($73 billion), [and] the child tax credit ($56 billion)…will not touch health care, child care, or housing”
- Tax changes (there’s uncertainty around these estimates)Stern: Phase out most tax expenditures (currently $1.2T/year); possibly add VAT of 5–10%, 1.5% wealth tax on assets over $1M, financial transaction tax, and Peter Barnes’ “Sky Trust”Murray: 17% phase-out of basic income for incomes between $30,000 to $60,000 ($5,000 for incomes above $60,000)Santens: End “home ownership tax expenditures ($340 billion), married filing jointly preferential tax treatment ($70 billion), the tax break on pensions ($160 billion), fossil fuel subsidies ($33 billion), and treating capital gains differently than ordinary income ($160 billion);” add a “[carbon tax] starting at $50/ton with annual increases of $15/ton”, a 0.34% financial transaction tax, seignorage reform, 10% VAT, and 5% land value tax


### Current proposals reduce benefits for some

By limiting to adults, the Stern and Murray plans both leave most poor single-parent households significantly worse off than they are today, as Daniel Hemel finds in his [well-researched criticism](http://newramblerreview.com/book-reviews/economics/bringing-the-basic-income-back-to-earth) (this also describes the “plan” in the survey question opposed by 70% of economists). These households currently receive thousands of dollars per year from EITC, CTC, SNAP (f.k.a. food stamps), and other programs like housing assistance (if they’re in the [lucky 24%](http://www.urban.org/urban-wire/one-four-americas-housing-assistance-lottery) of eligible households to get it).

Santens proposes $4,598 per child, in accord with [federal poverty guidelines](http://familiesusa.org/product/federal-poverty-guidelines) (adding 10% to compensate for a VAT), which vary depending on household size. But does even this amount per child compensate for lost benefits and higher taxes? Not for everyone. Consider two households earning $10,000 per year: one with a single childless person, and the other with a single person and a child. The value of marginal benefits received by the latter household is attributable to the child.

The three largest programs for this sample household total $5,958 in value, or $1,400 more than the basic income:

- $3,002 from EITC ($3,371 vs. $371 for the childless household)
- $1,956 in SNAP benefits ($3,032 vs. $1,076)
- $1,000 from CTC


> “In most of the [basic income] proposals, the losers tend to be households with more children.” — Jason Furman

Another example: all three plans are limited to citizens, despite some existing programs being [partially available](https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/overview-immigrants-eligibility-snap-tanf-medicaid-and-chip) to legal permanent residents.


### Plans’ various tax increases create more losers

In addition to some households getting less in benefits under the proposed plans, the suite of tax increases required to finance them would hit virtually everyone, including the poor. To name a few items, people could expect to pay more for:

- Gas and electricity (carbon tax)
- Rent and real estate (land value tax and ending the mortgage interest deduction)
- Groceries (value added tax and ending farm subsidies)

This doesn’t mean these taxes aren’t worthwhile on their own: [each](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/tax-reform) [enjoys](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/11/economist-explains-0) [broad](http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2009/02/news-flash-economists-agree.html) [support](http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2009/10/value-added-tax.html) [among](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/04/consensus-of-economists-cut-carbon-pollution) economists (I support all).

But these ideas bear no innate relationship to basic income, and their political baggage would weigh down the cause. For example, economists have been trying to kill the mortgage interest deduction for [decades](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/magazine/how-homeownership-became-the-engine-of-american-inequality.html?_r=0), only to be consistently rebuffed by the real estate lobby. Pursuing basic income need not require battling the real estate, agriculture, and fossil fuel industries.

It’s also hard to pin down how much each person pays for these taxes, relative to, say, income tax hikes. That increases the variance of who wins and who loses under these plans, meaning they could hurt even more low-income households.

For reasons I elaborate on shortly, I favor income taxes instead to avoid these issues.


### A person-centric direction

Fundamentally, the three plans start with a number: the amount believed needed to fund a basic income for the included population. These are big numbers — roughly $3T per year for each plan — so then they fill in the gaps with whatever it takes (except higher income taxes). Examination of example households has followed the design.

Let’s turn that on its head: instead of starting with the number, we can start with the people, and focus on maximizing the upside of each while minimizing the downside. The units of analysis would include people and households, not just dollars and cents.

This paradigm is harder to work in. It requires deep understanding of household income distributions, safety net program design, and tax codes. It then requires model-building to alter each while minimizing negative impacts. This often involves teams of policy analysts under the direction of established think tanks or policymakers. So it’s understandable that Murray, Stern, and Santens haven’t gone there yet. While I don’t yet have a plan that does, I have some ideas on how to build one.


### How to build a person-centric UBI plan

We can distill policy design to three pieces:

- Non-negotiables. What’s the heart of the policy?
- Levers. What parts of the plan are adjustable?
- Assessment. How do we measure the policy’s success, subject to (1) and (2)? Alternatively: what are we optimizing for?

For basic income, **non-negotiables **(1) are fairly straightforward: a basic income plan must be universal, unconditional, and 100% cash. Universality may be stratified, such that children, people with disabilities, seniors (who receive Social Security), and/or noncitizens receive different amounts. It may not be stratified by the composition of the household; for example, two adults must receive the same amount whether they are in the same household or not (it is an individual-level program, in contrast with many existing programs).

**Levers **(2) could include several things, starting with those implicit in the three cited plans:

- Amount per adult (the primary lever)
- Different amounts for children and other categories listed above
- Clawback/phase-out rateFor example, Murray suggests a partial clawback, such that it’s a hybrid of UBI and a negative income tax, though some would say this violates a non-negotiable aspect of universality by retaining means-testing.
- Programs replaced
- Tax expenditures eliminated
- Additional taxes leviedBeyond new taxes Murray, Stern, and Santens propose, I would add income tax increases as an important lever.

**Assessment **(3) should concern the distribution of impacts to after-tax after-transfer income to individuals or households. This is difficult in the Murray, Stern, and Santens plans, since some of the funding sources aren’t easily translatable to this metric, but the one-parent one-child household example suggests that many households with children will see considerable drops in total income.

The most straightforward metric for quantifying this would be something like *average % loss per person*, i.e. ignore the winners and focus on losers*. *So if a two-person household was getting $30k after taxes and transfers (including in-kind benefits like SNAP), and with UBI they get $29k, their contribution to the metric would be -3.3% ($1k / $30k), weighted for two people.

This could be extended in a couple ways. For example, winners could be included, though with less weight since politics is (appropriately) loss-averse. Studies in behavioral economics suggest that [“losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion) so losses could receive double the weight of gains. The metric could also consider implicit wages lost due to program compliance time — perhaps at minimum wage — given existing programs require more paperwork and in-person time with bureaucrats than cashing a basic income check does. One could imagine other factors as well, such as utility lost due to restrictive in-kind benefits ([Pareto efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency) and [welfare economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_economics) could be other angles).

Within this framework, the goal becomes: **ensure some level of universal cash transfer by adjusting levels and financing, such that negative impact on households is minimized.**


### Negative income tax as a starting point

The simplest way to achieve this goal is to mimic the current suite of programs, with three important changes:

- Replace in-kind benefits with cash.
- Remove restrictions like work requirements.
- Shift from household-based to individual-based.

Since existing programs are means-tested instead of universal, this would not produce a true basic income. What it would produce is what’s called a [negative income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax), whereby people below a certain income level receive a payment which phases out with income. It turns out that most historical studies on “basic income” have actually been on negative income tax, which [nearly became law](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/why-arent-reformicons-pushing-a-guaranteed-basic-income/375600/) in the 1970s.

Importantly, one could design a negative income tax with *identical outcomes *to a universal basic income, and vice versa, once you set the baseline. The simplest way to turn negative income tax into basic income is to calculate the extra amount individuals get (anyone with income gets more under basic income than negative income tax), and raise their taxes by exactly that amount. After taxes and transfers, nobody gets any more or less. I’ve [written more about this](https://medium.com/basic-income/if-we-can-afford-our-current-welfare-system-we-can-afford-basic-income-9ae9b5f186af), including reasons to still prefer basic income to negative income tax.

To make this a bit more concrete, consider a household with one adult and one child. As FiveThirtyEight’s Andrew Flowers [showed](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/universal-basic-income/) in the chart below, this household faces “welfare cliffs” due to immediate or rapid phase-outs of existing programs like TANF, Medicaid, and CHIP, as well as the way they interact with each other and with income taxes.


![Earnings vs. after-tax after-transfer income. Source: FiveThirtyEight (line added by Max Ghenis).](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*QegETrzNLHzyOqWO.)

The household gets ~$19k when earning $0, and ~$38k when earning $50k, or an average [implicit marginal tax rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate#Implicit_marginal_tax_rate) of *100%-($38k- $19k) / ($50k-0) = ~***60%. **If that seems harsh, it is: while income taxes are progressive, the highest marginal tax rates (including assistance) are actually borne by low-income households, due to means testing.

I’ve added an approximate line of best fit to this chart to show what this would look like as a flat income tax. We can implement this line in one of two ways:

- Negative income tax with a $19k minimum (for the two-person household), 60% phase-out (up to $30k, at which the household neither gets a refund nor pays taxes), and 60% tax rate after $30k (up to $50k earnings)
- Basic income of $19k and 60% tax rate (up to $50k earnings)

**These produce the same result. **The household gets/pays the same amount given their earnings, and the government gets/pays the same in net taxes. The primary difference is that negative income tax comes without the sticker shock: [Wiederspan, Rhodes, Shaefer (2015)](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10875549.2014.991889) estimate that a negative income tax set at US poverty line and with a 50 percent phase-out rate could be 95% paid for with the combined budgets of EITC, SSI, SNAP, TANF, school meal programs, and housing subsidies ([here’s a Vox summary](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/30/15712160/basic-income-oecd-aei-replace-welfare-state)).

Here lies the core advantage of funding basic income with income tax increases: you can only make a basic income plan equivalent to negative income tax when funding via income taxes. The increase that may seem significant would not actually be felt by households, and with income taxes representing [47% of federal tax revenues](http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-where-do-federal-tax-revenues-come-from), it’s a known quantity that doesn’t create new enemies.

A person-centric analysis will reveal the appropriate minimum and shape of the line to minimize losses for households. This will depend partially on what programs basic income replaces (I tend to agree with Stern and Santens in leaving out healthcare programs like Medicaid and CHIP). Inputs to the analysis would include distributions of household earnings by size, and the inclusion criteria and amounts of each existing program (essentially the above chart for each household type). Turn the resultant negative income tax into a basic income, and we’ve got a fair, focused, realistic plan.

Idealism attracts people; realism convinces them. Media coverage of pilots and automation have generated massive interest in the *idea *of basic income, but without a better-thought-through plan, that interest is doomed to evaporate among those concerned with the welfare of real people.

It’s time to get in the weeds and make a plan that not only lives up to the ideals of basic income, but also maximizes the number of people benefiting from it.

### Reddit Featured a Misleading Headline on Education Secretary Nominee Betsy DeVos

[This headline](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/5eobxq/meet_your_new_a_secretary_of_education/) made the top of [Reddit](http://reddit.com)’s [r/all](http://reddit.com/r/all) page on [Thursday](http://web.archive.org/web/20161124230946/https://www.reddit.com/r/all/):


> Meet your new a [sic] Secretary of Education: billionaire, creationist, charter school advocate, she’s anti-gay marriage, daughter of Amway founder, sister of Blacwater [sic] CEO, she is the largest donor to the worst Religious Right hate groups. Making America Great Again!

The post in the [r/atheism](http://reddit.com/r/atheism) subreddit linked to Libby Nelson’s Vox [article](http://www.vox.com/2016/11/23/13735102/betsy-devos-education-donald-trump) titled “Betsy DeVos: Donald Trump’s education secretary pick shows school vouchers are at the top of his agenda,” published Wednesday. The article was informative, but the editorialized headline on Reddit was misleading. Here I examine each claim and describe my attempt to report the issue.

*I neither assert equivalence of social media misinformation between the left and right (right-wing posts are *[at least twice as likely](https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/partisan-fb-pages-analysis?utm_term=.kloB4j3PG#.owQMpq130)* to be false), nor endorse this nomination.*


![This top-rated Reddit post contains multiple questionable claims.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mjZDK24rWgiJZMqxe1yxCA.png)


#### “billionaire”

**PROBABLY**

Betsy’s father, Edgar Prince, founded the Prince Corporation, which was sold for $1.35B in 1996, the year after his death. Betsy is one of Edgar’s four children.

Forbes estimates the net worth of Betsy Devos’s father-in-law, 90-year-old Amway co-founder Richard DeVos, at [$5.1 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway#Pyramid_scheme_accusations). Betsy’s husband, Dick DeVos, is one of Richard’s four children.

Betsy and Dick DeVos also [founded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_DeVos#Business_career) the [Windquest Group](http://windquest.com/) in 1989, a private equity firm which Betsy serves as chairwoman.

Betsy and Dick’s combined joint stakes of the Prince fortune, Amway fortune, and own venture may not exceed a billion, but [Snopes estimates that it does](http://www.snopes.com/betsy-devos-education-secretary/) so I’ve rated it “probably.”


#### “creationist”

**MAYBE**

While Betsy and Dick DeVos are prominent members of the [Christian Reformed Church in North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Reformed_Church_in_North_America), which [believes in creationism](https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/position-statements/creation-science), they haven’t themselves made public statements on it. Betsy’s [Washington Post profile](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/11/23/betsy-devos-trumps-education-pick-is-a-billionaire-philanthropist-with-deep-ties-to-the-reformed-christian-community/) states “She will not likely be one to focus on curriculum issues like evolution and creationism, which has been a concern in some conservative Christian circles.”


#### “charter school advocate”

**TRUE**

Nelson writes in Vox:


> DeVos has a long history of activism on one issue: school choice — a term that refers to both school vouchers, which allow parents to use taxpayer money to send their children to private school, and charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately run [and are not religious].


#### “anti-gay marriage”

**HUSBAND WAS IN 2008**

According to the nonpartisan [followthemoney.org](http://followthemoney.org), Dick DeVos (Betsy’s husband) [gave $20,000](http://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?m-eid=10246473&m-t-rt=3&d-eid=23175) to a ballot committee supporting [Michigan’s 2004 Prop 04–2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Proposal_04-2), an amendment to the state constitution which banned same-sex marriage. The proposal passed with 59% of the vote. In 2008, he [gave $100,000](http://www.followthemoney.org/entity-details?eid=23175&default=contributor) to [Florida’s Amendment 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Amendment_2_%282008%29) which also defined marriage as between a man and a woman. The proposal passed with 62% of the vote.


![US sentiment on same-sex marriage has shifted rapidly (Gallup)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uINpPjE_KOWoN9hUEh-IcQ.png)

In June, Betsy and Dick [gave](http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/wealthy-devos-family-offers-400000-to-pulse-shooting-victims-and-2-million-to-anti-lgbt-groups/) $400,000 to victims of the shooting at Orlando’s gay Pulse nightclub.

Note: Searching for [DeVos gay marriage](https://www.google.com/search?q=DeVos+gay+marriage) yields several articles claiming that Dick and Betsy have a more extremist opposition to same-sex marriage. Much of these articles focus on the broader DeVos family, where [evidence is more abundant](http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/wealthy-devos-family-offers-400000-to-pulse-shooting-victims-and-2-million-to-anti-lgbt-groups/). Several also claim that Betsy and Dick DeVos spent $200,000 (not $20,000 as shown in followthemoney.org) on Michigan’s 2004 measure banning gay marriage, and that they led the effort. This claim seems to [originate](https://twitter.com/wirecan/status/802219858171662337) with an [article](http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=57829) by LGBT publication [PrideSource](http://www.pridesource.com/), which states “In 2004 Betsy and Dick DeVos led the effort to put the anti-marriage amendment on the ballot and contributed over $200,000 to the campaign to enshine [sic] discrimination into the Michigan constitution.” I’ve [asked](https://twitter.com/MaxGhenis/status/802233253792878592) PrideSource for a primary source on this, given the conflicting data and lack of evidence they led the effort.


#### “daughter of Amway founder”

**DAUGHTER-IN-LAW**

[Amway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway) was founded by Richard DeVos, father of Betsy’s husband Dick DeVos. Amway “is an American company that uses a multi-level marketing model to sell a variety of products, primarily in the health, beauty, and home care markets.” Along with other companies adopting multi-level marketing models, Amway has been criticized for its [similarity to pyramid schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway#Pyramid_scheme_accusations).


![John Oliver recently criticized Amway and other multilevel marketing models.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uWDPBnfal2b1AKZSMx0Gsg.jpeg)


#### “sister of Blacwater [sic] CEO”

**Former CEO (1997–2009)**

According to Wikipedia, Blackwater, now known as [Academi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academi), “is an American private military company, originally founded in 1997 by former Navy SEAL officer [Erik Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Prince).” Erik is the brother of Betsy DeVos (nee Prince), and after founding Blackwater in 1997 he “served as its CEO until 2009 and later as chairman, until Blackwater Worldwide was sold in 2010 to a group of investors.” Blackwater was a controversial piece of the Iraq war, symbolizing the military-industrial complex after receiving a no-bid contract and later killing civilians in multiple incidents.

To the extent that the headline suggests a conflict of interest, it’s noteworthy that Erik Prince has not been involved in the organization for seven years. He currently heads a private equity firm.


#### “largest donor to the worst Religious Right hate groups”

**A STRETCH**

[MediaMouse](http://mediamousearchive.wordpress.com/) — a progressive blog focused on Grand Rapids area — has [catalogued](https://mediamousearchive.wordpress.com/resources/right/) the network of conservative individuals and organizations in West Michigan. Of organizations profiled on this site, her [page](https://mediamousearchive.wordpress.com/resources/right/people/betsy-devos/) claims she is linked to the pro-life [Compass Academy](https://mediamousearchive.wordpress.com/resources/right/orgs/compass-academy/), laissez-faire climate-change-denial [Acton Institute](https://mediamousearchive.wordpress.com/resources/right/orgs/acton-institute/), and [Education Freedom Fund](https://mediamousearchive.wordpress.com/resources/right/orgs/education-freedom-fund/) which provides scholarships for private schools. None are designated hate groups, and from their descriptions none seem to be anywhere near the most hateful religious right groups out there.

I shared this information with the r/atheism moderators to justify *flairing *(tagging) the post as “Misleading title.” They could also add a “stickied” comment with clarifications, which sits at the top of the comment tree for everyone to see. They declined, saying that


> There are plenty of sources in the thread corroborating every single item in the headline, so, no thank you.

None of the top 100+ comments at the time included any such corroboration, aside from a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/5eobxq/meet_your_new_a_secretary_of_education/dae3u1g/) to MediaMouse, and some comments questioned the claims.

The [user](https://www.reddit.com/user/PlanetoftheAtheists) who posted the story has a history of sensationalist titles getting to the front page of top subreddits like r/atheism. And subreddit moderators are incented to have popular posts, as getting featured on r/all often leads to new subscribers.

Some subreddits like [r/news](http://reddit.com/r/news) (a default subreddit, meaning it’s shown on reddit.com for new or logged-out users; r/atheism is not default) have stricter headline requirements, such as using the a line from the article itself. That would have helped here, but even basic fact-checking should be the norm for such prominent sites. Reddit administrators (who have more privileges than subreddit moderators) could take a stand on this too; while r/all is intended to be unfiltered, they could at least check titles for factual inaccuracies.

Reddit isn’t the only place Betsy DeVos has been mischaracterized. A [meme](https://www.facebook.com/seusstastic/photos/a.214339368609095.56033.206299406079758/1271355676240787/?type=3&theater) has been going viral on Facebook claiming she gave $9.5M to Trump’s campaign and $200M to Christian schools and organizations. The former claim is false: neither [Betsy](http://www.followthemoney.org/entity-details?eid=23375) nor [Dick](http://www.followthemoney.org/entity-details?eid=23175) nor [Betsy and Dick as a couple](http://www.followthemoney.org/entity-details?eid=553118) gave to Trump (though they gave to other GOP candidates), and Betsy [did not endorse Trump](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/betsy-devos-who-never-endorsed-trump-tapped-as-education-secretary/article/2608117). Her brother, Erik Prince, also [did not donate](http://www.followthemoney.org/search-results/SearchForm?Search=erik+prince&action_results=Go) to the Trump campaign. Snopes [looked into](http://www.snopes.com/betsy-devos-education-secretary/) the latter claim (with the rest of the meme) and rated it true based on their total giving, but it’s unclear whether they actually donated a full $200M to Christian causes.

Betsy DeVos is an understandably controversial nominee. Her lack of government experience creates uncertainty about her management capacity. Charter schools and vouchers are lightning rods, especially for teachers unions, which include the [largest union in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Education_Association). [Poor charter school results in Detroit](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/opinion/betsy-devos-and-the-wrong-way-to-fix-schools.html?_r=0) where she exerted influence suggests she may be driven more by ideology than by evidence. And her [deep involvement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/11/23/betsy-devos-trumps-education-pick-is-a-billionaire-philanthropist-with-deep-ties-to-the-reformed-christian-community/) in local Christian organizations combined with voucher support suggests she may try to divert public funds to religious schools (this prospect concerns me most).

There’s no need for the exaggeration and fabrication more commonly found on the right. Legitimate criticism of this nomination can stand on its own.

*Update: after *[posting this](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/5f2igq/reddit_ratheism_featured_a_misleading_headline_on/)* to r/atheism, they locked the post, threatened to ban me, and then banned me for “brigading”.*

*This post has been updated to reference Snopes’ fact-checking of the Facebook meme. It has also been corrected to reflect that r/politics is not a default subreddit. It was later updated to include Erik Prince’s lack of Trump campaign donations.*

## Uber’s tipping settlement will reduce earnings of african-american drivers

**URL:** https://maxghenis.com/blog/medium/ubers-tipping-settlement-will-reduce-earnings-of-a/
**Published:** 2016-04-26
**Description:** ### Uber’s Tipping Settlement Will Reduce Earnings of African-American Drivers

### Uber’s Tipping Settlement Will Reduce Earnings of African-American Drivers

This week, Uber [reached a settlement](http://fortune.com/2016/04/21/uber-drivers-settlement/) with drivers in California and Massachusetts in a lawsuit concerning worker classification. In addition to up to $100M in compensation, recognition of a driver’s association, and greater transparency about deactivating drivers, the settlement permits drivers to post signage in their vehicles soliciting tips. Uber drivers could always accept cash tips, but [unlike Lyft](https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/213583978-How-to-Tip-Your-Driver), Uber has never had an in-app tipping option, and [emphasizes](https://help.uber.com/h/1be144ab-609a-43c5-82b5-b9c7de5ec073) that “you don’t need cash…there’s no need to tip.” As a result, tipping is rare: Uber drivers estimate that [between one and five percent](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/10/27/tips-raises-questions-and-tempers-among-uber-and-lyft-users/EJlZe8Eb763UewRzUNUVJN/story.html) of riders tip, versus [70% of Lyft customers](http://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-reaches-a-tipping-point-with-its-drivers-1461490205) (though [some Lyft drivers claim 20–50%](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/10/27/tips-raises-questions-and-tempers-among-uber-and-lyft-users/EJlZe8Eb763UewRzUNUVJN/story.html)).

In a political climate focused on fair wages, tipping may seem like an innocuous solution to the gig economy, as adopted by Lyft and other services. However, if Uber’s pricing model works correctly, this move will be unlikely to increase average earnings, and research from the taxi industry suggests it will reduce earnings for black drivers who will be tipped less than their white counterparts.

Since Uber does not plan to add an in-app tip option, it’s unlikely to generate tips from 70% of riders, as Lyft claims. A [2014 Bankrate survey](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/consumer-index/financial-security-index-cashs-cachet.aspx) found that 40% of American consumers carried under $20 in cash, while 9% carried none at all. These fractions have surely grown, and are surely overrepresented among Uber users ([a 2014 study](http://www.icba.org/millennialstudy/) found that 24% of millennials carried under $5 in cash). Tip solicitation will tax the few remaining cash-carriers not already accustomed to Uber’s previous abandonment of the custom. Five percent of fares may be a reasonable expectation of the new tip amount (for instance if 25% of riders tip 20% each).

Pressuring riders to diverge from an increasingly cashless society to tip ([lest they suffer a poor passenger rating from their driver](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-22/tipping-is-coming-to-uber-and-it-s-going-to-be-awkward)) will inconvenience users who have come to favor Uber’s easy transactions. But the greater impact will be on black drivers. A [Yale study](http://www.yalelawjournal.org/essay/to-insure-prejudice-racial-disparities-in-taxicab-tipping) provides concerning evidence:


> The authors collected data on more than 1,000 taxicab rides [by twelve drivers] in New Haven, Connecticut in 2001. After controlling for a host of other variables, they find….African-American cab drivers were tipped approximately one-third less than white cab drivers [no significant results were found for other ethnicities]…Both black and white passengers participated in the discrimination against black drivers.

This aligns with other research on tipping, such as a [2014 Cornell study](https://static.secure.website/wscfus/5261551/1619831/socinq-2014-earning-gap.pdf) finding that black servers were tipped ~10% less than white servers. Clearer norms around restaurant tipping relative to taxi tipping likely contribute to the stronger effect in the taxi setting.

Perhaps lower tips for black drivers are tolerable if tipping increases earnings for all drivers, but this is highly unlikely. While Uber [says](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-22/tipping-is-coming-to-uber-and-it-s-going-to-be-awkward) that it has no plans to reduce fares under the assumption that riders will tip, their dynamic pricing algorithm means that this will happen anyway. A review of their [surge pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber_%28company%29#Surge_pricing) explains why:


> Uber uses an automated algorithm to increase prices to “surge” price levels, responding rapidly to changes of supply and demand in the market, and to attract more drivers during times of increased rider demand, but also to reduce demand…Surge pricing increases economic efficiency in two ways: 1. rising prices motivate more drivers to start driving, 2. when there are not enough drivers for everyone, the rising prices make only those customers accept a ride whose needs are highest.

For example, if more riders in rush hour want rides than drivers are available, fares might be 1.5x normal. If tips become more common (as is expected from this settlement) without fares being reduced, drivers will expect higher hourly rates and thus more will drive (driver supply rises), while riders will be less likely to seek Uber rides given their expectation of higher prices (due to tips). This means that surge pricing will be less necessary, surge multipliers will fall, and the resulting fall in fares will offset average tips. Even drivers who didn’t drive in surge periods would earn less in base fare, due to tip expectation reducing rider demand (e.g. these drivers may end up circling more). An economist might phrase this as: tipping changes neither the supply nor demand curves, so as long as Uber’s algorithm continues to set prices optimally, neither tip-inclusive prices nor tip-inclusive driver earnings will change, on average.

This on-average offsetting of tips by fare reductions ignores tip discrimination. Since black drivers are tipped less, their lost fares will exceed the average tip amount; conversely, white drivers would be expected to come out ahead. To illustrate: assuming [$19/hour in earnings](https://newsroom.uber.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BSG_Uber_Report.pdf) and a 6% tip rate as estimated above (5% of fares, adjusted for Uber’s 20% cut), we would expect $1.14 in average tips. We would also expect fares to fall by $1.14, either due to surge multipliers falling, more circling, or a mix. Given black drivers are tipped ⅓ less than white drivers and a driver population that is [18% black and 37% white](https://newsroom.uber.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BSG_Uber_Report.pdf), we would expect black drivers to be tipped [$0.86/hour vs. $1.28/hour](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D9nooGdzRDlwB42iOoDVe3M_Pv20-QLt5dHIdkU2NFA/edit#gid=0) for white drivers. Adding back the fare of $19 — $1.14 = $17.86/hour, black drivers would earn $18.72 total, 2.2% less than white drivers’ $19.14 total earnings, or 1.5% less than their current $19 earnings. This may not seem like much, but it translates to full-time black drivers earning $870 per year less than their white counterparts. If Uber added in-app tipping and generated Lyft’s 70% tip rate, black drivers would be expected to earn [6.3% less than white drivers, or $2,500 per year](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D9nooGdzRDlwB42iOoDVe3M_Pv20-QLt5dHIdkU2NFA/edit#gid=1559191869).

Research from the restaurant industry has found other issues with tipping: it’s [correlated to sexual harassment](http://rocunited.org/new-report-the-glass-floor-sexual-harassment-in-the-restaurant-industry/) against waitresses (notable for the [14% of Uber drivers](https://newsroom.uber.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BSG_Uber_Report.pdf) who are female) and [corruption](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9491448/Here%27s-a-Tip_Torfason,Flynn,Kupor-Tipping-and-Bribery-6-6-12-SPPS.pdf?sequence=1), and nearly [uncorrelated to service quality](http://scholarship.sha.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1110&context=articles). While this research hasn’t been replicated in taxis, it’s plausible that the trends extend to transportation.

Few deny that driving for Uber can be financially difficult, but introducing tipping creates more problems than it solves. Should it become the new norm, riders can reduce discrimination by tipping a fixed amount regardless of perceptions of service quality (which are prone to [unconscious bias](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/upshot/the-measuring-sticks-of-racial-bias-.html?_r=0)). The new challenges of the gig economy will not be solved by voluntary measures like tipping; instead they require bold action from society as a whole to expand the social safety net ([I favor universal basic income](https://medium.com/basic-income/if-we-can-afford-our-current-welfare-system-we-can-afford-basic-income-9ae9b5f186af), as is [popular among technologists](http://www.vice.com/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1)).

Despite this setback, much progress has been made in tipping reform, with [nearly 200 restaurants](http://bit.ly/tip-free-restaurants) having now abandoned the practice. While Uber’s stance on tipping thus far has protected black drivers from discrimination, permitting drivers to solicit tips weakens such protections. They should remove this clause from their settlement to ensure their platform provides unbiased financial opportunity for all drivers.

**Update: ***Uber clarified in a *[blog post](https://medium.com/@UberPubPolicy/our-approach-to-tipping-aa0074c0fddc#.ifie7830q)* that “Tipping is not included, nor is it expected or required.” The piece also provides rationale for their stance on tipping, which includes bias and references studies listed here.*

### If We Can Afford Our Current Welfare System, We Can Afford Basic Income

[Basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income) (BI) is getting a lot of press these days. From [Switzerland’s upcoming referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_referendums,_2016#Basic_income_referendum) to give each citizen 2,500 francs per month, to [GiveDirectly](http://givedirectly.org)’s research upending the philanthropy world, to [Finland’s plan](https://agenda.weforum.org/2015/12/finland-basic-income/) for a 2017 BI pilot, more are warming to the idea that just giving people money may be the solution to poverty.


> A basic income is an income unconditionally granted to all on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement. — Basic Income Earth Network

Many dismiss basic income as unaffordable. The reality is that basic income is only a form of redistribution, independent of the amount to be redistributed. It is therefore equally affordable to any existing [social safety net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_safety_net). Specifically, budgets for existing programs can fund BI via these revenue-neutral steps:

- Replace current antipoverty programs dollar-for-dollar with cash transfers.
- Reform income eligibility requirements to ensure people are always better off upon earning an extra dollar.(1) and (2) can be consolidated into a “negative income tax” (NIT)
- Implement negative income tax as an equivalent basic income.

That is, NIT should be attractive to those looking to simplify the suite of antipoverty programs and improve work incentives. As I’ll argue below, BI and NIT are effectively equivalent, so BI would be just as attractive. This article lays out the conceptual case for getting to basic income without major changes to federal budgets or tax burdens.


#### Replacing the antipoverty bureaucracy

The US federal government currently spends over a trillion dollars per year helping the poor through over 100 programs (some shown below). Some are well-known, such as [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program) (SNAP, f.k.a. food stamps), housing assistance, [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Assistance_for_Needy_Families) (TANF, f.k.a. welfare), and the [Earned Income Tax Credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit) (EITC). The majority are much smaller, each providing particular goods or services to those in need, and many more programs provide help at the state and local levels.


![Source: US House Committee on Ways and Means](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_463AHxG0pTQ4QJe2RgUbA.jpeg)

This assortment of programs creates three key issues:

- Overhead. Even large federal programs typically have considerable administrative costs. For example, a 2012 study from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities found that SNAP and housing vouchers each cost 9–10% in overhead expenses. The same study found that the EITC (a cash transfer) cost under 1%.
- Burden on recipients. Administrative dollar figures fail to capture the time-consuming and demeaning experience for recipients, who must learn about, apply for, and comply with the tomes of forms and provisions of each program.
- Paternalism. When programs dictate the specific uses of funds, they ignore the varying preferences of the poor. For example, some may want to spend more on housing, while others may prefer to spend more on food. By purchasing the goods and services for them in fixed quantities, we remove their option to participate in markets according to their tastes. This results in what economists call deadweight loss, a form of inefficiency from lack of market equilibrium.

Some of these programs will likely be more effective than their cash value — especially those serving the physically disabled and mentally ill — and should remain intact. But most could be more easily administered and humanely received as cash grants. Assuming utilization rates remain constant, this is clearly revenue-neutral. Unfortunately, this not always the case due to stigma and difficulty of application and compliance (e.g., [SNAP has ~75% utilization](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/14/food-stamps_n_3757052.html)); if an easier cash experience attracts more recipients, benefits could be adjusted to remain revenue-neutral in aggregate.


#### Eliminating welfare cliffs

Replacing current benefits dollar-for-dollar with cash leaves a big problem on the table: welfare cliffs (or [welfare traps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_trap)). A welfare cliff occurs when a recipient, upon earning a [marginal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_concepts) dollar, loses a [means-tested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_test) benefit (one that goes away if you earn over a certain amount) of greater value than the dollar. This creates work disincentives which can be sizable. For example, as depicted in the below graph, a single mom in Pennsylvania collects more income+benefits earning $29k than she does earning $69k.


![Source: Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KUwN_9ngzJzk6yf3u_jV2A.jpeg)

Non-cash benefits are particularly prone to welfare cliffs, since they can be real goods and services not easily divisible (e.g. childcare). Cash, on the other hand, can be distributed to eliminate cliffs, plus smooth out the curve. A smooth curve means that anyone can easily predict their total income+benefits as a function of their income, spending less time optimizing for benefits. To be revenue-neutral, some people will be worse off with a smooth curve (e.g. those earning $29k getting maximum benefits), and others will be better off (e.g. those who lose $6k of benefits after earning just over $29k). But every dollar earned will lead to improved livelihood.

Replacing non-cash benefits with cash, and smoothing out the curve, has been formalized into a policy called [negative income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax) (NIT). This policy provides a government payment to those below a certain income level (called the *phase-out level*)* *equal to a fraction of the difference between their income and the phase-out level (more on that below). Nobel prize-winning economist [Milton Friedman ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman)—known as one of the leaders of the [Chicago school of economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_school_of_economics#Milton_Friedman) — popularized the policy when he [advocated](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/NegativeIncomeTax.html) it in his 1962 book, [Capitalism and Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism_and_Freedom).

While the proposal never passed, a partial solution called the (previously mentioned) [Earned Income Tax Credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit) (EITC) was implemented instead in 1975. The EITC is now [widely](https://newrepublic.com/article/74453/americas-most-effective-anti-poverty-program) [cited](https://newrepublic.com/article/74453/americas-most-effective-anti-poverty-program) [as](http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_25058579/americas-most-effective-anti-poverty-program-is-also) [one](http://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/eitc-and-child-tax-credit-promote-work-reduce-poverty-and-support-childrens) of the most effective antipoverty programs in the US, [having lifted 6.2 million people out of poverty in 2013](http://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/policy-basics-the-earned-income-tax-credit).

The negative income tax goes further by covering all below the phase-out level ([EITC targets working families with children](http://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/policy-basics-the-earned-income-tax-credit)), ensuring full utilization ([15–25% of households eligible for EITC don’t claim it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit#Uncollected_tax_credits)), and increasing impact by absorbing budgets from other programs.


#### From negative income tax to basic income

By replacing the onerous bureaucracy of antipoverty programs and eliminating welfare cliffs, negative income tax would go a long way to improving the lives of the poor. However, some differences make basic income more compelling:

- Frequency of distribution. Like other tax rebates, negative income tax payments are distributed annually. Basic income can be distributed monthly or more often, which aligns better to its purpose of satisfying basic ongoing needs.
- Simplicity. Negative income tax still requires some math to determine the payment based on total earnings. Recipients of basic income know exactly how much they get every month.
- Social cohesion. A payment received by all equalizes and unifies a society, creating concrete consequences to government revenue and spending policies. The Nordic countries, for example, have favored universal government programs funded by broad-based taxes.

Fortunately, for any given negative income tax structure, an equivalent basic income structure exists. Consider a NIT with a phase-out level of $30k, a 50% marginal withdrawal rate, and a 50% income tax (unrealistic, but this simplifies calculations). This means that someone earning $0 will receive $15k* (($30k - $0) * 50%)*, someone earning $30k will neither receive payments nor pay income taxes, and someone earning $60k will pay $15k in taxes *(($60k - $30k) * 50%)*. We can visualize this as a chart mapping gross (earned) income to net (after taxes and payments) income (similar to the Pennsylvania welfare cliff chart):


![Source: Model by Max Ghenis](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*st-CaMF7ogj3pxnHBYXcmw.png)

As the title gives away, this same mapping from gross income to net income is achieved with a basic income of $15k and a flat income tax of 50%. The US progressive tax code complicates things a bit, but it’s provable that any negative income tax scheme — regardless of the income tax rates — can be implemented equivalently as a basic income (via income taxes, in some cases changing rates). More money passes through government, but for affected taxpayers, it’s money out one pocket and back in the other.

As the world moves to an age of increasing globalization and automation, more will be drawn to the benefits of basic income. Many questions remain about the idea, for example, its effectiveness, optimal payout, and whom it should include. While studies have addressed some questions (e.g. cash transfers[ don’t reduce work incentives](http://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/1813-9450-3973)), the various experiments planned for the next couple years will yield even better data.

But if basic income is achieved via the above strategy — replace existing non-cash programs with cash, smooth out the payout curve to avoid welfare cliffs, and substitute negative income tax with basic income — affordability does not belong on the list of concerns. If the BI produced by this approach is too low, that is an indication that the existing welfare state is too stingy; if it doesn’t adequately address the needs of society, then neither do today’s programs. Criticisms of the safety net’s size (in either direction) are orthogonal from the notion that basic income is a more efficient means of distribution.

Poverty is not a vague incurable condition, but one that can be directly eradicated via basic income. Finland’s proposal to move 100% to BI is admirable, but other countries can start with small steps like expanding EITC and reforming means tests. With basic income attainable, now is the time to seriously push toward its implementation.
